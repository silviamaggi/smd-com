## The problem

How can you design a product that helps travellers prepare and acclimatize fast for their trip so they don’t miss a minute of fun?

## The solution

A mobile app that gives people access to accurate weather information about their travel destinations, and to crucial messages from local authorities.

## My role

Solo project, based on a  where I explored the process from finding the users’ needs to visual design.

## End users

**Travellers** who want to be able to enjoy their trips in full.

## Job story

> When I travel I want to what to expect so I can enjoy my stay from start to finish.

## Persona

{% include pattern-figure.html image="/assets/images/acclimatize.me-wanderer-jill.png" caption="" width="256" height="256" %}

Jill enjoys travelling and often plans a weekend away. Whether to ski or to relax on a beach, Jill worries her trips will be ruined if she doesn’t know enough about her destination. It happened a few times already.

She is used to spending time researching a destination, but it feels like only local people are prepared for certain types of weather and events. As her job keeps her increasingly busy, Jill would love to find a smart way to stay in the know.

### Goal

Jill’s goal is to acclimatize rapidly to her destination and be prepared for any changes so that she can enjoy every minute of her trip.

### Behaviour

Jill is tech-savvy. She always makes time to read books and travel. Fascinated by other cultures, she loves to learn as much as possible about them. That’s why Jill treasures her trips and the local people she meets.

## Analysis

The following is an analysis to find out which areas provide design opportunities, taking into account existing solutions and competitors.

### Desired outcomes

If there were a solution that can help her, the following table lists the outcomes Jill would like to have.

Outcome (table)
Know what to wear
Be prepared for changes to weather
Ability to ask locals
Ability to ask other travellers
Know how it feels (based on humidity, wind)
Information is easy to find
Solution is easy to set up
Solution is easy to use
Solution has strong privacy options

### Importance

The **importance** of each outcome, rated on a scale of 1-10.

Outcome	Importance (table)
Know what to wear	10
Be prepared for changes to weather	10
Ability to ask locals	10
Ability to ask other travellers	10
Know how it feels (based on humidity, wind)	9
Information is easy to find	8
Solution has strong privacy options	8
Solution is easy to set up	8
Solution is easy to use	8

### Current satisfaction

The **current satisfaction** with an existing service or app, rated on a scale of 1-10.

Jill is currently using weather apps, Tripadvisor and Yelp to get the information she needs for her travels. Each solution has its advantages, but it’d be even better to have one place where to find all the information she needs.

Outcome	Importance	Current satisfaction (table)
Know what to wear	10	2
Be prepared for changes to weather	10	3
Ability to ask locals	10	3
Ability to ask other travellers	10	3
Know how it feels (based on humidity, wind)	9	4
Information is easy to find	8	5
Solution has strong privacy options	8	4
Solution is easy to set up	8	8
Solution is easy to use	8	8

### Design opportunity

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted has-normal-font-size">
**Importance – Current satisfaction = Design Opportunity**
</pre>

In **bold** are the outcomes the design solution should strive to achieve. Because they have a higher score, they have the potential to outperform current solutions.

The outcomes that are highly important but are already satisfied are baseline outcomes that users would expect to find in the solution.

Outcome	Design Opportunity (table)
**Know what to wear**	**8**
**Be prepared for changes to weather**	**8**
**Ability to ask locals**	**7**
**Ability to ask other travellers**	**7**
Know how it feels (based on humidity, wind)	5
Information is easy to find	4
Solution has strong privacy options	4
Solution is easy to set up	0
Solution is easy to use	0

## Use case

For the sake of this case study, I focus on the interaction of setting up and receiving weather and local authorities notifications. This will help users manage weather changes without ruining their trips.

## Storyboard

* On the web version of the app, which Jill visits before her trip to Chamonix, she checks the weather and all the information and advice available.
* After arriving at her destination, she sets up the alerts. On a day when she wanted to ski, the weather is forecast to change dramatically for the worst.
* Jill can change plans in time and make the most of her day.

## User flow

Let’s explore what are the steps Jill will take to set up the alerts.

First, she decides to allow notifications. Then, she selects the destination, the date range of her stay, and what type of alerts she wants.

Any important weather changes or communication from the local authorities will trigger notifications on her phone.

## Sketches
I sketched the basic screens involved in setting the alerts.

## Wireframes

During this phase, the interaction became clearer and the screens more detailed.

I used the wireframes to test the solution, and subsequently iterated based on the feedback received.

## Visual design

The latest iteration of the solution is represented by the visual design.

With the intent of guiding the users through an intuitive procedure to set up the alerts, I:

* added more navigational elements (breadcrumbs) to help users know where they are and how long is the process;
* used typography and colour to highlight hierarchy and functionality;
* took care of the details and consistency of the interface.
