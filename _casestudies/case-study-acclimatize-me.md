## The problem

How can you design a product that <strong>helps travellers prepare and acclimatize fast for their trip</strong> so they don’t miss a minute of fun?

## My role

Solo project, where I explored the process from finding the users’ needs to visual design.

## User story

> *When I travel I want to what to expect so I can enjoy my stay from start to finish.*

## Proto-persona

<div class="clearfix">
{% include pattern-figure.html image="/assets/images/acclimatize.me-wanderer-jill.png" caption="Wanderer Jill" class="float-md-start mb-3 mb-lg-5 me-md-4 text-center" width="150" height="150" %}
<p>Jill enjoys travelling and often plans a weekend away. Whether to ski or to relax on a beach, <strong>she worries her trips will be ruined</strong> if she doesn’t know enough about her destination. It happened a few times already.<br>She is used to spending time researching a destination, but it feels like <em>only local people are prepared for certain types of events</em>. As her job keeps her increasingly busy, Jill would love to find a smart way to stay in the know.</p>
</div>

## Storyboard

<ol>
<li>Jill visits the web version of the app before travelling. She checks the weather and all the available information and advice.</li>
<li>She starts her trip to Chamonix.</li>
<li>Upon arrival, she sets up the alerts.</li>
<li>On a day when she wanted to ski, the weather is forecast to change dramatically for the worst.</li>
<li>Jill can change plans in time.</li>
<li>She makes the most of her day.</li>
</ol>

## User flow

Let’s explore what are the steps Jill will take to set up the alerts. First, she decides to allow notifications. Then, she selects the destination, a date range for her stay, and what type of alerts she wants.

Any important weather changes or communication from the local authorities will trigger notifications on her phone.

## Sketches

Setting up the alerts.

Receiving the notifications.

## Wireframes

I used the wireframes to test the solution, and subsequently iterated based on the feedback received.

## Visual design

Following feedback from travellers and interviewers, I've updated the design of the app to be:

<ul class="smd-ul">
<li><strong>Simpler</strong>. The initial idea was for it to be a tool that does one thing: setting up alerts to avoid travel uncertainties.</li>
<li><strong>More private</strong>. People shouldn't need to create an account to receive notifications.</li>
</ul>

{% include pattern-figure.html image="/assets/images/acclimatize-me-v2-visual-design-notifications.jpg" caption="Notification received" width="1400" height="800" %}

### Previous version

With the intent of **guiding the users through an intuitive procedure** to set up the alerts, I:

<ul class="smd-ul">
<li>added more navigational elements (breadcrumbs) to help them know where they are and how long is the process;</li>
<li>used typography and colour to highlight hierarchy and functionality;</li>
<li>took care of the details and consistency of the interface.</li>
</ul>

## Prototype

Try the prototype — fullscreen available using the controls within the container below.

<div class="iframe-container"><iframe loading="lazy" style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2F2UOI7kiE7NHy3jpxTwmbXx%2FAcclimatize.me-App%3Fpage-id%3D1108%253A397%26node-id%3D1202%253A384%26viewport%3D241%252C48%252C0.37%26scaling%3Dscale-down%26starting-point-node-id%3D1202%253A384" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

## Conclusions

Starting from the straightforward process of setting up alerts, this app has potential. It can have discussion forums and be a place where to share travel experiences, make new friends and even meet them to explore new places together. Although, the market offers similar tools — e.g. Tripadvisor — and I believe apps should be helping as opposed to creating more noise in people's lives. *Acclimatize.me* should be an app you set up and forget.
