## The problem

How can you design a product that helps travellers prepare and acclimatize fast for their trip so they don’t miss a minute of fun?

## The solution

A mobile app that gives people access to accurate weather information about their travel destinations, and to crucial messages from local authorities.

## My role

Solo project, based on a  where I explored the process from finding the users’ needs to visual design.

{% include toc.md %}

## End users

Travellers who want to be able to enjoy their trips in full.

## Job story

> When I travel I want to what to expect so I can enjoy my stay from start to finish.

## Proto-persona

<!-- Jill enjoys travelling and often plans a weekend away. Whether to ski or to relax on a beach, Jill worries her trips will be ruined if she doesn’t know enough about her destination. It happened a few times already.

She is used to spending time researching a destination, but it feels like only local people are prepared for certain types of weather and events. As her job keeps her increasingly busy, Jill would love to find a smart way to stay in the know.

### Goal

Jill’s goal is to acclimatize rapidly to her destination and be prepared for any changes so that she can enjoy every minute of her trip.

### Behaviour

Jill is tech-savvy. She always makes time to read books and travel. Fascinated by other cultures, she loves to learn as much as possible about them. That’s why Jill treasures her trips and the local people she meets. -->

<!-- ## Use case

For the sake of this case study, I focus on the interaction of setting up and receiving weather and local authorities notifications. This will help users manage weather changes without ruining their trips. -->

## Storyboard

<ul class="smd-ul">
<li>On the web version of the app, which Jill visits before her trip to Chamonix, she checks the weather and all the information and advice available.</li>
<li>After arriving at her destination, she sets up the alerts. On a day when she wanted to ski, the weather is forecast to change dramatically for the worst.</li>
<li>Jill can change plans in time and make the most of her day.</li>
</ul>

## User flow

Let’s explore what are the steps Jill will take to set up the alerts.

First, she decides to allow notifications. Then, she selects the destination, the date range of her stay, and what type of alerts she wants.

Any important weather changes or communication from the local authorities will trigger notifications on her phone.

## Sketches

The basic screens involved in setting the alerts.

## Wireframes

During this phase, the interaction became clearer and the screens more detailed.

I used the wireframes to test the solution, and subsequently iterated based on the feedback received.

## Visual design

The latest iteration of the solution is represented by the visual design.

With the intent of guiding the users through an intuitive procedure to set up the alerts, I:

<ul class="smd-ul">
<li>added more navigational elements (breadcrumbs) to help users know where they are and how long is the process.</li>
<li>used typography and colour to highlight hierarchy and functionality.</li>
<li>took care of the details and consistency of the interface.</li>
</ul>
