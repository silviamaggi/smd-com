## Job story

> *When I travel I want to what to expect so I can enjoy my stay from start to finish.*

## Proto-persona

<div class="clearfix">
{% include pattern-figure.html image="/assets/images/acclimatize.me-wanderer-jill.png" caption="Wanderer Jill" class="float-md-start mb-lg-5 mb-sm-3 me-md-4 text-center" width="150" height="150" %}
<p>Jill enjoys travelling and often plans a weekend away. Whether to ski or to relax on a beach, <strong>she worries her trips will be ruined</strong> if she doesn’t know enough about her destination. It happened a few times already.<br>She is used to spending time researching a destination, but it feels like <em>only local people are prepared for certain types of events</em>. As her job keeps her increasingly busy, Jill would love to find a smart way to stay in the know.</p>
</div>

## Storyboard

<ol>
<li>Jill visits the web version of the app before travelling. She checks the weather and all the information and advice available.</li>
<li>She starts her trip to Chamonix.</li>
<li>After arriving at her destination, she sets up the alerts.</li>
<li>On a day when she wanted to ski, the weather is forecast to change dramatically for the worst.</li>
<li>Jill can change plans in time.</li>
<li>She makes the most of her day.</li>
</ol>

## User flow

Let’s explore what are the steps Jill will take to set up the alerts. First, she decides to allow notifications. Then, she selects the destination, a date range for her stay, and what type of alerts she wants.

Any important weather changes or communication from the local authorities will trigger notifications on her phone.

## Sketches

The basic screens involved in setting the alerts.

## Wireframes

I used the wireframes to test the solution, and subsequently iterated based on the feedback received.

## Visual design

With the intent of **guiding the users through an intuitive procedure** to set up the alerts, I:

<ul class="smd-ul">
<li>added more navigational elements (breadcrumbs) to help them know where they are and how long is the process;</li>
<li>used typography and colour to highlight hierarchy and functionality;</li>
<li>took care of the details and consistency of the interface.</li>
</ul>

## Prototype

<div class="iframe-container"><iframe loading="lazy" style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2F2UOI7kiE7NHy3jpxTwmbXx%2FAcclimatize.me-App%3Fnode-id%3D221%253A499" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

## Conclusions

Starting from the straightforward process of setting up alerts, this app has potential. It can have discussion forums and be a place where to share travel experiences, make new friends and even meet them to explore new places together. Although, the market offers similar tools — e.g. Tripadvisor — and I believe apps should be helping as opposed to creating more noise in people's lives. Acclimatize.me should be an app you set up and forget.
