Last day of the year &mdash; the infamous 2016 &mdash; and as usual, it's almost impossible not to think back to what happened, and decide whether it has been a great year or not.

For me, it's been a great year. There has been sadness, some difficult moments, yet I'll remember 2016 as a good one.

In September, my husband and I marked our fifth year in the UK and one year since we moved from London to Cambridge.

Since the first time we visited, we felt Cambridge could have been a good choice for us. During the past year, that feeling has become a reason to be proud of the relocation and the lifestyle we chose for us.

Neither of us is really a big city person, and the perfect mix of rural and urban elements of Cambridge really fits with our needs.

For the first time, we have a garden, which is a great way to understand how everything needs time, patience and care to grow. Noticing the changing landscapes all around us helps to keep a calmer pace, and making the most of what we have.

I'm very happy and still surprised some of my photos have been in [exhibitions](/tags/exhibitions/). It never happened before, and it all started after being contacted by [Shutter Hub](https://shutterhub.org.uk/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}'s Karen. Before that, all I did was taking lots of photos and forget them on a hard
drive.

One of the reasons to maintain a blog is to use the photos to tell stories and to help me keep going with <a href="https://2016/12/30/photo-project-the-change-of-seasons-part-1-summer/">The Change of Seasons</a> project.

Soon, I'll be publishing a new exciting project, linked to a great theatrical music album.

Welcome, 2017.
