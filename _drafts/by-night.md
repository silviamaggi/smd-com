With days shorter and colder, sometimes it's difficult to find the right time to go out and take some pictures.

<!--more-->

It is still too dark when commuting back from work, so I started taking pictures by night, even though I was never comfortable doing so. I wasn't sure my camera could handle the low light conditions very well, and probably my hands weren't steady enough to avoid bringing a tripod.

Whatever the result, I enjoyed trying. It seems like, when it's darker, the world slows down a bit, even in very busy crossroads.
