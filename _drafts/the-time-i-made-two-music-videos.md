<p class="has-large-font-size">'<strong>After 1989: A trip to freedom</strong>' is my husband <a aria-label="Simone (opens in a new tab)" href="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link">Simone</a>'s debut solo album, and an emotional journey. I documented it with pictures and created two music videos.</p>

<p>It's been a while since I wanted to publish this project, and today I finally did. Because it seemed to be less important than the UX case studies, and I didn't know how to present it, I postponed it indefinitively.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Now that my portfolio is in <a aria-label="good shape (opens in a new tab)" href="https://silviamaggidesign.com/silvia-maggi-portfolio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="rank-math-link">good shape</a>, it felt right to choose the photos, review the videos and tell the story of my collaboration with Simone.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I had the idea of making it always <strong>visible in my portfolio as a side project</strong> only very recently, as a way to give an immediate idea of who I am and what I do.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Not that making music videos is something I always do, on the contrary. But I loved it, as it gave me the&nbsp;<strong>opportunity to measure myself with a medium I wasn’t very familiar with</strong>&nbsp;– video.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Storytelling is important in my profession, and in every case there is a message we want to pass.</p>
