Some time ago, I found the website [UX Challenge](http://www.uxchallenge.co/), signed up to their newsletter and started working on a problem. The initial intention was to exercise for interviews.

To answer the question:

> How can you design a product that helps travellers prepare and acclimatize fast for their trip so they donâ€™t miss a minute of fun?

I explored a solution to help people make the most of their trips no matter the weather.

As I went through the UX process, I noticed my interest towards this question intensified, so I decided to use it as a case study for my portfolio.

My motivation for solving this specific problem for travellers stems from the personal experience of [a stay in Bordeaux]({{ site.url }}/photography/four-days-in-bordeaux/) a few years ago. Everything was great, with the exception of the weather event that caught us off guard.
