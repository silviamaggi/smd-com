There have been a lot of changes since my <a href="https://2017/03/19/photography-rut-and-little-things-in-my-garden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">last post with photos of flowers and plants in my garden</a>.

The _Spanish Bluebells_ flowered.

For the first time since we moved here &mdash; almost two years ago &mdash; our _Red Robin_ flowered too.

The Helios-44M's bokeh is perfect for shooting flowers and plants, and I can't seem to get enough of it.
