UniCredit Bank wanted to reach a wider range of clients. UI Farm helped them increase the conversion rates of their mobile pages.

[UniCredit Bank](https://unicredit.it/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, a leading European commercial bank headquartered in Italy, wants to leverage the increasing use of smartphones to reach a wider range of clients.

To do so, they contacted [UI Farm](https://uifarm.co.uk/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, the London-based web agency I co-founded that specialised in **device-agnostic responsive design**.

It’s 2013. In Italy, a small percentage of people uses smartphones to go online; even fewer to make purchases.

Together, we devised a content strategy to **build trust through the user interface**.

This is a case study I’ve been working on lately. **I chose it to represent the way I think and work because I’m still very proud of it**.

Working on case studies is not just something UX designers have to do, it’s a good exercise too. Considering what went well and what didn’t can help balance our memories.

Reminiscing about the work done for UniCredit **boosted my confidence and energy**. If you have the time to read it, I hope you enjoy it.
