For months, almost daily, I took pictures with my mobile phone of my commute to work. Some of them are published on my Instagram account. I wanted to have a recollection of the views, always the same but always changing.

The project started in July 2016 and finished in June 2017.

Around March I lost a few pictures, while January and February weren’t the most prolific months.

Focussing on one project for an entire year – and limiting it with the use of the phone camera only – has proven difficult to me. Could be a coincidence, but at some point, I lost interest in it and tried to bring back my photography enthusiasm by [pointing my lens to the small details around me](https://0.0.7.225/03/19/photography-rut-and-little-things-in-my-garden/).
