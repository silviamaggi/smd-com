On Thursday 6th October 2016, Shutter Hub and the Old Girl’s Club launched GIRL TOWN at London Photomonth, and I’m very proudly part of it.

GIRL TOWN is a selected exhibition of photography celebrating the culture of the female in the 21st Century. It’s been curated through Instagram, so it is possible to see all the entries by exploring the hashtag [#girltownPM](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/girltownpm/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

The selected 200 photos are visible at the lovely St Margaret’s House, London, until 1st November 2016.

GIRL TOWN is also a series of talks, meetups, films screenings.

Programme and other information [here](http://shutterhub.org.uk/blog/girltownpm){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

The exhibition already got [very good press](http://www.whitechapelgallery.org/first-thursdays/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and, the night of the opening, it was announced that next year it’ll be going to Tel Aviv.

I couldn’t have imagined a better result, not even in my wildest daydreams!
