## Brief
Rebrand of the existing website, create a site to work on multiple devices and with the ability to manage content. The other five agencies’ website had the same need.

## What I did
Together with my colleagues at UI Farm, I developed the site based on the provided design on a custom WordPress framework, allowing the client to fully manage the content, including a blog.

## Features

{: .smd-ul }
- Multi-city main menu, with custom drop-down sub-menu when needed.
- Multi-columns layout with latest news and social feeds (Instagram and Twitter) for the agency. In the model pages this changes to the model’s related latest news and social feeds.
- Integrated with Women Management’s backend model booking system and social media content.

{: .smd-ul }
- Models board, using our custom responsive grid, adapted for all devices.
- Clicking on a letter, a smooth scrolling animation points to the correct models names.
- On mobile and tablet devices, the grid adapts to the different features. Big letters are “tappable” to open and close the related models.

We implemented a responsive full screen carousel, to go through the model’s portfolio. A custom feature allows users to print a PDF version of the related book.
