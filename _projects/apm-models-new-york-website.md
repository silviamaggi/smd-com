## Brief
Create a website to announce APM’s foray into high-end fashion and to create a digital experience different to that of the existing talent agencies.

## What I did
Together with my colleagues at UI Farm, I redesigned APM’s website, creating a branded experience to highlight their modern take on the model agency world. We used our bespoke framework to build the WordPress-based website.

## Client review

>Rebuilding a company website is oftentimes seen as a daunting and perhaps overwhelming task. It’s a time-consuming struggle that every company must face. I didn’t think I’d ever see it, but the glimmer of hope came when I connected with UI Farm. Since day 1, working with them has been nothing but a pleasant and enjoyable experience. Any issue or bug I could have possibly run into was analysed, explained, and solved instantly with minimal back-and-forth. The site looks impeccable, the cost was reasonable, and working with UI Farm was nothing short of a good time. I definitely would recommend the whole team at UI Farm for all your website needs – you’ll definitely come away with something to be proud of and you’ll also be hit with a laugh or two along the way.
