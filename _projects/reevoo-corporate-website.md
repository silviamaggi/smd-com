## Brief
Create a new responsive website based on Reevooâ€™s brand guidelines to showcase the companyâ€™s full product offering and generate sales leads. Create a multi-device experience to show prospective clients a real-time feed of Reevooâ€™s review, ratings and conversations from their existing clients. 

## What I did
Togheter with my colleagues at UI Farm, I implemented a fully responsive WordPress website using Reevooâ€™s brand guidelines. Tailored for multi-devices, the website was built using UI Farmâ€™s framework and features integration with tools such as Salesforce/Pardot for lead generation and LinkedIn for authentication. Developed a live demo as a bespoke responsive web application to show potential clients how user generated content such as reviews, ratings and conversation could be delivered and embedded on their web products.

## Client review

> I had the pleasure of working with UI Farm, as we re-built our corporate website using WordPress while making it responsive. From the very get go, UI Farm were extremely professional and proactive with the build process and worked with us closely as requirements evolved. This ability to adapt changes in an agile manner is a key aspect that differentiates them from other firms. The new website was launched on time and was perfect on all devices, all in all testament to a job well done.
