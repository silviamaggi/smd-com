## Brief
CounterBooks had a very mature product but, following rebranding, the application needed a refresh. As the system has a strong market in Germany, Scandinavia and Eastern European countries, the UI elements needed to be adaptable to all languages.

## What I did
Together with my colleagues at UI Farm, I redesigned the user interface and interactions of the application from scratch. After a thorough analysis of the existing website, we started designing the UI of the complex navigation formed by a three level menu and breadcrumbs, and all the main pages. Each of us provided a design and iterated from there until the client was happy with the last version.

{% endresponsive_image_block %}

As considerable amount of the website content is grouped in tables, we created effective responsive tables to be correctly visualised on tablets. All the graphic elements are defined via CSS so that a longer copy wonâ€™t break the layout.

{% endresponsive_image_block %}

CV Retail developers would be implementing the design, and we delivered the HTML5/CSS multi-device prototype of the new application interface with a fully modular style guide for ease of reference.

## Client review

>UI Farm took on board our initial brief and quickly came up with a number of alternative designs that demonstrated their understanding of our ideas and requirements. UI Farm provided us with all the artefacts required for our web developers to transform our dated web front- end into an attractive, distinctive and modern user interface that transforms the image of our product.
