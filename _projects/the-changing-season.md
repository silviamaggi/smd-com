When in July 2016 I started a new job, I switched from working from home to going to the office. My commute started from north-est, near Fen Ditton, and ended at the _Science Park_.

Every day I enthusiastically picked up my bicyle and pedalled through the beautiful _Ditton Meadows_ and _Stoubridge Common_, crossed the river Cam at the _Green Dragon Bridge_ and reached the Science Park via _Green End Road_. It was before the Cambridge North Station was built, making my journey shorter and safer along the Guided Busway extension.

## The project

I decided to take at least a picture a day in a bid to appreciate my surroundings. Although the idea was to do it for a year, I managed to shoot for nine months. In the middle of the project I found myself in a [photography rut](/photography/photography-rut/): I was tired of the same scenery, or simply too in a rush to stop the commute. The following is a selection of the pictures organised by month. 

## July

## August

Cows are a big feature in this commute. They're peaceful and pretty much still but would sometimes stand on the path. As their size can be intimidating, I tried to leave them alone. That sometimes meant dismounting and walking on the grass.

## September

## October

Everything went from beautiful to stunning. I will be forever thankful to the woman in the yellow jacket for her good taste and perfect timing.

## November

At this point I started to use the bus often, which was cumbersome. I took the _citi 3_ to the city centre, then the _citi 2_ toward the Science Park. A cummute that took no less than 45 minutes. At the end of month, the first frost appeared.

## December

On the morning of 5 December I slipped on black ice in Green End Road. A kind woman stopped her car to help me get up from the curb and beneath my bicycle. I hurt my hands and left knee. During the following months I bought a lighter bicycle, but it took me a few months to gain the confidence to cycle again.

## Conclusions

Putting aside a few difficulties encountered with this project, I happily completed it. Now I have a visual record of the period where I felt as closed to nature as I was during my childhood. I loved cycling, even when it rained — a bit less when it was freezing — and combining it with photography has been a lifeline during challenging times.
