## Brief
Redesign the blog, combining a Multisite WordPress instance into a single coherent, branded website. Their ever increasing multi-device audience drove the need for a responsive website.

## What I did
Together with my colleagues at UI Farm, I worked with [Notonthehighstreet.com](https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/ "Visit the NOTHS website")’s creative department to implement the responsive redesign in WordPress. We created custom WordPress plugins to fit the client’s needs.

## Features

{: .smd-ul }
- Fully branded, responsive website.
- WordPress installation using a combination of custom WordPress plugins and UI Farm’s responsive framework.
- Subtle use of animations to enhance the user experience.
- Social media integration from platforms such as Twitter and Instagram.

## Responsive implementation

{: .smd-ul}
- “Hero” and featured posts.
- Social integration.
- Sticky navigation.
- Animated headers.
- Customisable Call to Actions and Search.

## WordPress custom integrations

{: .smd-ul }
- “Hero” post WordPress template with customisable background image.
- WYSIWYG Visual Composer, with custom modules tailored to the client’s requirements.
- Custom functionality to show all the media included in the post.
- Social integration.

## Media gallery

{: .smd-ul }
- Sharing capabilities on every image.
- Based on the editor’s choice, a Call to Action links either to the full screen gallery or to the product’s shop page.

## Client review

>We were really pleased with the results of working with UI Farm. We challenged them with our request for two beautiful and on brand WordPress websites with a tight time frame. They delivered on time and on budget and were very flexible on the
minor changes we wanted to make.
