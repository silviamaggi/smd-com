> Silvia is one of those interface developers that has the great benefit of coming from a design background - yet has a strong technical foundation. This has proven to be a major asset within our web team. She works with a high attention to detail and leaves no stones unturned. Very positive and can-do attitude; a valuable member of the team.

She combines her outstanding knowledge of design and development to provide you with one talented UI developer than any front-end team would be proud to have on their team.
