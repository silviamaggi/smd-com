  This is a place where time flows differently. Past, present and future happen at the same time. There is no clear structure, and the rules are different. It's a place for <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> experiments and creativity, in Italian and English. I borrowed the concept from <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4955642/" title="Read about the TV series on IMDb" rel="noopener">The Good Place</a>.
