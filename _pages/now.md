  <li class="border-bottom mt-2">Recently moved back to the UK. I’m literally home again, in Cambridge, in the same house. <a href="https://silviamaggidesign.com/personal/home-again/">Read the post</a></li>
  <li class="border-bottom mt-2">Started learning to play the <a href="https://silviamaggidesign.com/tag/ukulele/">ukulele</a>, after years of regrets</li>
  <li class="border-bottom mt-2">Finished working on a small project, will start a job search soon</li>
  <li class="border-bottom mt-2">Currently reading: I finished <em>Lady Susan</em>, by Jane Austen, and was reading <em>To The Lighthouse</em>, by Virginia Woolf, but I’m not terribly inspired by my <em>In progress list</em>. <a href="https://silviamaggidesign.com/books/books-im-reading/">See the whole list</a></li>
