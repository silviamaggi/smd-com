A few days ago, my husband and I moved back to the UK. More on this soon, when the house will start looking like a home.

## Work

I am specialising in [digital accessibility](https://silviamaggidesign.com/category/accessibility/ "View posts under the 'accessibility' category"). The plan is to complete <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/web-accessibility-introduction">the course <em>Introduction to Accessibility</em> on edX</a>.

## Reading

My main goal is to <a href="https://silviamaggidesign.com/tag/news/" title="read my posts about news consumption">avoid reading the news every day</a>, focusing on the many books I bought. <a href="https://silviamaggidesign.com/books/books-im-reading/">See my reading list</a>.

## Hobbies

After a long hiatus that started just before the pandemic, [I've picked up knitting again](https://silviamaggidesign.com/personal/back-to-knitting/). For now, it’s a matter of exercising as I’ve lost my dexterity.

Another hobby I’m slowly picking up again is [photography](https://silviamaggidesign.com/category/photography/ "View all posts under the 'photography' category"). Feeling uninspired ever since the pandemic made me sad, because photography is a passion I’ve been cultivating since around the age of 12. I’m planning to create a website to collect and regularly publish my photos. It won’t offer the ability to comment or like, as I’ve lost interest in those after [I’ve left algorithmic social media](https://silviamaggidesign.com/personal/life-off-social-media/ "read what happened when I left social media").

This is my *now page*, where I tell you what I am up to at this point in my life. [You can make one, too](https://nownownow.com/about).
