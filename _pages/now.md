I’m currently living in Italy, between Lake Maggiore and Milan. My husband and I are planning to move back to the UK in 2023, where we lived for almost 10 years up until the pandemic.

## Work

I’m contracting with an Italian web agency in the role of UX designer for <a href="https://www.bper.it/">BPER Bank</a>. Work is mostly remote. I am specialising in [digital accessibility](https://silviamaggidesign.com/category/accessibility/ "View posts under the 'accessibility' category"), having trained in-house and recently helped UniCredit Bank comply with the WCAG 2.1 (AA) rules. The plan is to complete <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/web-accessibility-introduction">the course <em>Introduction to Accessibility</em> on edX</a> and get the official certification.

## Reading

My main goal is to <a href="https://silviamaggidesign.com/notes/note-about-news-consumption/" title="read a brief note about news consumption">avoid reading the news every day</a>, focusing on the many books I bought.

In progress:

- _The Deception of Harriet Fleet_, by Helen Scarlett
- ~~_Extra Bold – A Feminist, Inclusive, Anti-racist, Nonbinary Field Guide for Graphic Designers_~~, by multiple authors
- ~~_Hamnet_, by Maggie O’Farrell~~
- ~~_Stories of Your Life and Others_, by Ted Chiang~~
- ~~_The Norkfolk Mystery_ by Ian Samson~~
- ~~_Women & Power_ by Mary Beard~~
- ~~_The Essex Serpent_ by Sarah Perry~~
- ~~_Pigeon English_ by Stephen Kelman~~


## Hobbies

After a long hiatus that started just before the pandemic, [I've picked up knitting again](https://silviamaggidesign.com/personal/back-to-knitting/). For now, it’s a matter of exercising as I’ve lost my dexterity.

Another hobby I’m slowly picking up again is [photography](https://silviamaggidesign.com/category/photography/ "View all posts under the 'photography' category"). Feeling uninspired ever since the pandemic made me sad, because photography is a passion I’ve been cultivating since around the age of 12. I’m planning to create a website to collect and regularly publish my photos. It won’t offer the ability to comment or like, as I’ve lost interest in those after [I’ve left algorithmic social media](https://silviamaggidesign.com/personal/life-off-social-media/ "read what happened when I left social media").
