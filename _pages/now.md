My husband and I finally moved back to the UK, and [I started writing about it](https://silviamaggidesign.com/personal/home-again/).

## Reading

My main goal is to <a href="https://silviamaggidesign.com/tag/news/" title="read my posts about news consumption">avoid reading the news every day</a>, focusing on the many books I bought, and long read form articles. <a href="https://silviamaggidesign.com/books/books-im-reading/">See my reading list</a>.

This is my *now page*, where I tell you what I am up to at this point in my life. [You can make one, too](https://nownownow.com/about).
