I’m currently living in Italy, spending more time than ever in my hometown [Arona, by Lake Maggiore](https://silviamaggidesign.com/tag/arona/ "View posts tagged 'Arona'"). As I had left this place roughly 20 years ago to follow my passions in Milan, being here at this point of my life is both strange and pleasant. 

## Work

I’m working as web consultant and UX designer for an Italian web agency. Work is mostly remote. I am specialising in [digital accessibility](https://silviamaggidesign.com/category/accessibility/ "View posts under the 'accessibility' category"), having trained in-house and recently helped UniCredit Bank comply with the WCAG 2.1 (AA) rules. <mark class="smd-highlight d-inline">The plan is to complete <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/web-accessibility-introduction">the course <em>Introduction to Accessibility</em> on edX</a> and get the official certification.</mark>

## Reading

<mark class="smd-highlight d-inline">My main goal is to <a href="https://silviamaggidesign.com/notes/note-about-news-consumption/" title="read a brief note about news consumption">avoid reading the news every day</a>, focusing on the many books I bought.</mark> 

In progress:

- _Extra Bold – A Feminist, Inclusive, Anti-racist, Nonbinary Field Guide for Graphic Designers_, by multiple authors
- _Stories of Your Life and Others_, by Ted Chiang
- _The Norfolk Mystery_, by Ian Sansom


## Hobbies

After a long hiatus that started just before the pandemic, [I've picked up knitting again](https://silviamaggidesign.com/personal/back-to-knitting/). For now, it’s a matter of exercising as I’ve lost my dexterity.

Another hobby I’m slowly picking up again is [photography](https://silviamaggidesign.com/category/photography/ "View all posts under the 'photography' category"). Feeling uninspired ever since the pandemic made me sad, because photography is a passion I’ve been cultivating since around the age of 12. <mark class="smd-highlight d-inline">I’m planning to create a website to collect and regularly publish my photos.</mark> It won’t offer the ability to comment or like, as I’ve lost interest in those after [I’ve left algorithmic social media](https://silviamaggidesign.com/personal/life-off-social-media/ "read what happened when I left social media").
