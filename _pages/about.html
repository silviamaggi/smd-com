<p class="lead">I started my career as a <strong>designer and developer</strong> focussing on <em>usability, accessibility and information architecture</em>. For nine years, I lived in the UK, where I co-founded the web agency <a href="https://uifarm.co.uk/" title="Go to the UI Farm website">UI Farm</a> and worked for clients spanning several industries, such as <strong>finance, retail and energy</strong>.</p>

<p>In 2020 I took a career break to deepen my knowledge and become a better and more conscious UX designer. Read more about my work history <a href="{{ socialnav[0].link }}" title="Go to my LinkedIn profile">on LinkedIn</a>.</p></p>

<h2 class="display-6">Interests</h2>
<p><strong>Photography</strong> is my life-long passion. Over the past few years, I contributed to several exhibitions, and authored <a href="/portfolio/after-1989-a-trip-to-freedom/" title="Check the side project on my website">two music videos</a> for my husbandâ€™s debut album. In a bid to better my visual communication skills, I started <a href="/drawing/learning-to-draw/" title="Read the article on my website">learning to draw</a>.</p>
<p>At the first hint of autumn, I often start <strong>knitting</strong> small accessories for family and friends. Being close to nature is important to me. Itâ€™s where I can clear my mind, get inspired and relax.</p>
