<h2 class="display-6">Interests</h2>
<p><em>Photography</em> is my life-long passion. Over the past few years, I contributed to several exhibitions, and authored <a href="/projects/after-1989-a-trip-to-freedom/" title="Check the side project on my website">two music videos</a> for my husbandâ€™s debut album. In a bid to better my visual communication skills, I started <a href="/drawing/learning-to-draw/" title="Read the article on my website">learning to draw</a>.</p>
<p>At the first hint of autumn, I often start <em>knitting</em> small accessories for family and friends. Being close to nature is important to me. Itâ€™s where I can clear my mind, get inspired and relax.</p>
