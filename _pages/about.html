<p class="lead"><strong>For nine years, I lived and worked in the UK</strong>, where I co-founded the web agency <a href="https://uifarm.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Go to the UI Farm website">UI Farm</a> and worked in several fields, including the energy sector.<br>I started my career as a web designer and developer, wanting to build intuitive, usable and accessible interfaces. Gradually, I focused on user experience, <em>bringing my attention from how things work to why</em>.</p>

<p>My mission is to <strong>create interactions that serve people and businesses best</strong>, through careful research and design. At the beginning of 2020, I took a career break — disrupted by the pandemic and an international move — to deepen my knowledge and become a better, more conscious, UX designer.

<h2 class="display-6">Interests</h2>
<p>Photography is my life-long passion. Over the past few years, I contributed to several exhibitions, and authored <a href="{{ site.url }}/portfolio/after-1989-a-trip-to-freedom/" title="Check the side project on my website">two music videos</a> for my husband’s debut album. In a bid to better my visual communication skills, I started <a href="{{ site.url }}/drawing/learning-to-draw/" title="Read the article on my website">learning to draw</a>.</p>
<p>At the first hint of autumn, I often start knitting small accessories for my family and friends. Being close to nature is important to me. It’s where I can clear my mind, get inspired and relax.</p>
