<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

<p class="lead">For nine years, I lived and worked in the UK, <strong>where I co-founded the web agency <a href="https://uifarm.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UI Farm</a></strong> and worked in several fields, including the energy sector.<br>I started my career as web designer and developer, wanting to build intuitive, usable and accessible interfaces. Gradually, I focused on user experience, <strong>bringing my attention from <em>how</em> things work to <em>why</em></strong>.</p>

<p>My mission is to **help creating interactions that serve people best**, through careful research and design.</p>

<p>At the end of 2019, I took a career break â€“ disrupted by the pandemic and an international move â€“ to deepen my knowledge and become a better, more conscious, UX designer.</p>

<h2>Newsletter</h2>

<p>I curate the **design inspiration** series _[Design, Digested](https://us10.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=0c9027b00ef8ad1210adae70d&id=d77c0b18a8){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}_, a newsletter about design, tech, their implications in our lives and the occasional photography work.</p>

<h2>Interests</h2>

<p>Photography is my passion: in the past, I participated in exhibitions as a contributor. Recently, I created [two music videos for my husbandâ€™s debut album](https://silviamaggidesign.com/portfolio/after-1989-a-trip-to-freedom/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.</p>

<p>At the first hint of autumn, I often start knitting small accessories for my family and friends.</p>

<p>Being close to nature is important to me. Itâ€™s where I can clear my mind, get inspired and relax.</p>
