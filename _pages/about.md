## Iâ€™m a UX designer striving to create meaningful, user-centric experiences

{% include pattern-figure.html image="/assets/images/silviamaggi-avatar.png" width="250" height="250" %}

For nine years, I lived and worked in the UK, where **I co-founded the web agency [UI Farm](https://uifarm.co.uk/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}** and worked in several fields, including the energy sector.

I started my career as web designer and developer, wanting to build intuitive, usable and accessible interfaces. Gradually, I focused on user experience, **bringing my attention from _how_ things work to _why_**.

My mission is to **help creating interactions that serve people best**, through careful research and design.

At the end of 2019, I took a career break â€“ disrupted by the pandemic and an international move â€“ to deepen my knowledge and become a better, more conscious, UX designer.

## Newsletter

I curate the **design inspiration** series _[Design, Digested](https://us10.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=0c9027b00ef8ad1210adae70d&id=d77c0b18a8){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}_, a newsletter about design, tech, their implications in our lives and the occasional photography work.

## Interests

Photography is my passion: in the past, I participated in exhibitions as a contributor. Recently, I created [two music videos for my husbandâ€™s debut album](https://silviamaggidesign.com/portfolio/after-1989-a-trip-to-freedom/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

At the first hint of autumn, I often start knitting small accessories for my family and friends.

Being close to nature is important to me. Itâ€™s where I can clear my mind, get inspired and relax.
