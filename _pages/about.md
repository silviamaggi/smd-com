I’m Silvia (she/her), I live in Cambridge (UK) with [my husband Simone](https://minutestomidnight.co.uk) in a small house with a garden. I don’t take myself too seriously. I like a good laugh and are gifted with good humour.

Born and raised in Italy, then moved to the UK in 2011, I’m bilingual in Italian and English. Unfortunately I don’t get to speak the other language I love, French.

Photography is my life-long passion. For a long time, I didn't replace Instagram when I quit my account in 2021: now [my photos have a new home](https://silviamaggiphotography.com). I contributed to a few [exhibitions]({{ site.url }}/exhibitions/).

I have several interests, which I write about in the blog. Some of them are: design, accessibility, sustainability, mental health.

Better to turn pages than to scroll.

<!-- Another passion of mine is design. During the first lockdown in 2020, I started publishing an inspiration series called [<em>Design, Digested</em>]({{ site.url }}/category/design-digested/) where I gather the articles that left an impression. -->
