Iâ€™m Silvia Maggi (she/her), a designer specialised in building accessible and usable products. I care about design ethics and sustainability.

## Iâ€™m a designer

Working alongside UX researchers, I enjoy creating experiences that best balance users and business needs. I mostly craft wireframes and prototypes.

I do accessibility audits, and advise clients on how to make their websites comply with their local legislation.

Both as a consultant and in-house, Iâ€™ve designed for clients spanning industries such as banking, retail and energy, impacting considerable amounts of people. In 2012 I co-founded the agency [UI Farm](https://web.archive.org/web/20180314165034/http://uifarm.co.uk/). 

My tools are Miro, Figma, and ProtoPie, although ideas take form on paper first. I also used: Sketch, InVision, and Adobe XD.

## Iâ€™m a developer

Always curious about how things work and why, I learned how to code early on. My favourite languages are HTML and CSS, which I used to create static sites, and later WordPress themes. 

More recently, I adopted Jekyll, Liquid and Markdown. 

With UI Farm, I used to *design in the browser*. The wireframes were done in HTML and CSS. Gradually, the simpler initial pages would become the real product.

My favourite editor is Sublime Text.

## Iâ€™m an archiver

In May 2020, I started *Design, Digested* â€“ the [design inspiration series](/category/design-digested/) and [newsletter](/newsletter/) about design, tech, and their implication in our lives. I gather the articles that leave an impression or become bookmarks, and share them.
