Dear Friend, 

If everything goes to plan, this will be my last weekend in the UK. It feels like a long time has passed since I last wrote to you, yet it happened less than a month ago. You know how it goes, moving is stressful. We sold or donated almost all our furniture. While doing so, we crossed paths with a lot of different people, giving them items we loved and listening to brief stories of their lives. 

I didn’t take any pictures or read anything about design in the meantime. Every night though, we watch Anthony Bourdain’s *Parts Unknown* on Netflix. It’s a fantastic way to travel without moving and learn fascinating facts about distant cultures. It’s good to keep anxiety at bay too, even if it leaves us craving food that’s not readily available. We also watched the documentary *The Social Dilemma*, a compelling view for anyone. Dr Steven Novella wrote a [thought-provoking review about it on Neurologica.org](https://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/review-of-the-social-dilemma/). 

Next time you’ll hear from me, I’ll be in my home country, Italy. I’m not sure how it will be after having spent nine years abroad. I need it though, as much as I need resting. 

<p class="detached">Keep safe,<br>
Silvia</p>
