Dear Friend,

In Italian folklore, the last three days of January (*i giorni della merla* â€“ the female blackbirdâ€™s days) should be the coldest of the year. They werenâ€™t. So, Winter is supposed to be longer. Legends are not exact science, but this year they might have a point. And Spring feels closer now.

<p class="detached">On a day when we were particularly keen, my husband and I walked <code>8 km</code> across the local pine forest. Itâ€™s been a lovely, sensory experience, but too much, too soon for our lockdown bodies.</p>

<p class="detached">Today, I listed the books Iâ€™m reading. Some of them are ideal if youâ€™re a designer, others are either very interesting or funny â€“ or both â€“ for anyone. The eye-opener for me was <em>The Culture Map</em> by Erin Meyer. We tend to see our culture systems when weâ€™re outside of them, or when weâ€™re in contact with people from other countries. <strong>In a more connected world, itâ€™s important to talk about our differences to overcome them</strong>.</p>

<p class="detached">As I decluttered my website, and changed the way I manage my spare time, I thought my inspiration series should change as well. Iâ€™m reading more books, but fewer articles. The ones I read and would like to share with you are more focused and require a bit more time to be digested.</p>

This month, deceptive patterns grabbed my attention. Because theyâ€™re everywhere, and designers are starting to talk about them. Most of the times, companies influence the design decisions that work against users instead of helping them. <strong>This approach is the exact opposite of what the user experience practice embodies</strong>. Whether youâ€™re someone who might end up designing deceptive patterns, or a person browsing the internet and using services, you need to recognise them and act accordingly.

## Important note

While the articles shared use the adjective â€™dark' to describe deceptive patterns, there is a conversation around the bad connotation it has. As of 9 January 2023, I have updated update the language I use to be more inclusive and not discriminatory.
