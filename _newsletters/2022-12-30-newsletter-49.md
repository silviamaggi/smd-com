The end the year is usually the perfect moment to slow down. When still living in the UK, I used to take the whole festive period off and spend days doing nothing in particular. Taking long walks, cooking together, watching films without looking at the clock were a few favourite activities.

Ever since moving back to Italy, because of many different reasons, the festive season feels strange. I believe one needs to feel at home to really enjoy it.

2023 should be the year when we move back to the UK and build ourselves a home again. To slow down and wrap up, I suggest four articles:

- What does it mean to really, truly rest?
- Comfort culture â€” why do we return to our favorite TV shows and art?
- How Hj&auml;rta Sm&auml;rta challenged the male-dominated status quo in the early 2000s?
- A lighter side of life â€” picture essay.
