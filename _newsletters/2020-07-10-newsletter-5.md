Dear Friends,

This week I have two things to share with you. One is the new instalment of my design inspiration series. Itâ€™s time for honest conversations about **anti-racism and misogyny in tech**.

Don Norman, the father of the term *user experience*, doesnâ€™t believe in empathic design. Empathy is paramount to understand the usersâ€™ needs and how to solve their problems. But Norman highlights how thatâ€™s impossible to achieve. 

Also in the list, how the cookies consent boxes went too far, and a video about how the inventor of *Super Mario Bros.*, Shigeru Miyamoto, designs video games.

The second one is a photography project that I recently published. I wanted to document the extraordinary times weâ€™re living. By no means the situation changed, but it feels like the project should be over:
