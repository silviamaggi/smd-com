Hi,

As announced on the last issue, I will publish _Design, Digested_ more frequently. However, I wonâ€™t write you more than twice a month.

You will notice that some of the links I share lead on unusual interfaces. They are [scribe.rip](https://scribe.rip/), and [archive.today](https://archive.is/). The former is an alternative frontend to Medium, the latter creates snapshots of webpages such as Substack articles.

The reason why I use these services is I donâ€™t like neither Mediumâ€™s nor Substackâ€™s business models[^controversy]. Although, some articles are worth sharing, hence the workaround.

## New on the website
As a reminder of everything that went well during the past four years, I published the sketches I made while following the Drawabox lessons.

## Design, Digested 54 â€“ Designing for healthy habits and positive impact on society
Three articles that I found informative, funny, and uplifting.

- How do you accidentally run for President of Iceland?
- Transforming the world: by design
