Hi,

Ever since the last newsletter, we had to dig up the plants and bring them back inside due to the cold and wet weather. Now theyâ€™re outdoors again and growing strong. Both Simone and I have started looking for a permanent job, which is proving difficult in the current market.

In other more personal news, I recently lost someone very close to my heart. Itâ€™s too early to write more about it, but Iâ€™m trying to keep a schedule and take things slow. Resuming blogging is part of it, and _Design, Digested_ will also become more regular again.

## Design, Digested 53
Of the few articles I read the past couple of months, the most memorable are about smartphones use and the ways modern tech can make us miserable.

- The smartphone kids are not all right
- Smartphone pervasiveness
- Heat death of the internet

See you soon,<br>
