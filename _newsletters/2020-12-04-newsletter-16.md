<p class="lead">Back after a two-months hiatus.</p>

<!--more-->

Dear Friend,

I looked at my calendar and realised itâ€™sÂ a little over two months since my husband and I moved back to Italy.Â Itâ€™s taking me time to get used to the change, but itâ€™s okay: there is no magic wand, and all we can do is to take it as it is, day after day. This week I have two posts to share with you.

As Instagram introduced significant layout changes â€” the tabsÂ ReelÂ andÂ ShopÂ â€” itsÂ navigationÂ becameÂ convoluted. Let's briefly explore why.
