It has been over two month since I last wrote you, and I have yet to solve the dilemma of being frequently in other peopleâ€™s inboxes while feeling overwhelmed by emails myself.

I decided to resume the _Design, Digested_ series, and keep sending out emails to those who want them. [The newsletter is also available via RSS](https://silviamaggidesign.com/newsletter.xml), which is what I use to keep up to date with my favourite content.

## Whatâ€™s new

Mine has been a summer of eccessive temperatures â€“ with a perceived 45ÂºC/113ÂºF for days â€“ and consequent inability to be productive.

Most notably though, I _went home_. Simone and I visited Cambridge for a few days in August and felt like we had never left. Itâ€™s been somehow easier to describe my feelings [when we visited London a month earlier](https://silviamaggidesign.com/personal/a-week-in-london/). While in this case, I have yet to process them.

Iâ€™ve been reading and playing a lot. The following posts keep being updated:

- [Books Iâ€˜m reading](https://silviamaggidesign.com/books/books-im-reading/)
- [Video games Iâ€˜m playing](https://silviamaggidesign.com/personal/videogames-im-playing/)

## Design, Digested 47 â€” Privacy, dreamhouses, the woman behind the author

The illusion of privacy, Barbie dreamhouses, Eileen Oâ€™Shaughnessy, the benefits of desk research and more.
