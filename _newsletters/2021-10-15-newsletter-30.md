<p class="lead">Steering away from the F word.</p>

<!--more-->

Dear Friend,

When checking the archive of links I use for *Design, Digested*, I felt discouraged. As almost everything had to do with social media, my reaction was to steer away from it. While I hope [Frances Haugen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Haugen){:target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read the article on Wikipedia"}’s efforts will produce positive outcomes, I preferred concentrating of something entirely different. This week I gathered a few articles that are etched in my memory, hoping you’ll find them inspiring.
