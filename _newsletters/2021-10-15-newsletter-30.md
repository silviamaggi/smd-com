Dear Friend,

When checking the archive of links I use for *Design, Digested*, I felt discouraged. As almost everything had to do with social media, my reaction was to steer away from it. While I hope [Frances Haugen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Haugen){:title="Read the article on Wikipedia"}â€™s efforts will produce positive outcomes, I preferred concentrating of something entirely different. This week I gathered a few articles that are etched in my memory, hoping youâ€™ll find them inspiring.
