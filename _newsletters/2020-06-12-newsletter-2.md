<p class="lead">Defining books, the words we use and more.</p>

<!--more-->

Dear friends,Â   
  
This week I want to share some crucialÂ articles and books from the past twentyÂ years, and some other information related to the new normal weâ€™re currently living.Â   

_Responsive Web Design_ is ten years old. Thatâ€™s something. Ethan Marcotteâ€™s article changed the way we design and develop websites. The books *Donâ€™t Make Me Think*, andÂ *Mobile First*Â are respectively 20 and 9 years old. And yet, theyâ€™re still relevant today.Â 

Our **word choice is crucial**. Language sets the tone of the stories we tell and influence how people perceive them. German politicians donâ€™t use the same language of other nations when they talk about the virus (and I like it).Â   

I canâ€™t wait to attend a webinar about designing with the constraint of social distancing. As it seems this is going to be the norm for the foreseeable future, we need to understand the problem and all its implications, quickly.Â 

<p class="detached">Stay safe,<br>
