Dear Friend,

It might sound bizarre, but Iâ€™m writing to you without having new blog posts or big news. I was initially embarrassed while thinking about what to tell you. Yet, what I read, watch and interests me everyday helps me grow. Or simply amuses me.

## What Iâ€™m reading

<p class="detached">ðŸ”— <a href="https://abookapart.com/products/just-enough-research" title="Check the book on A Book Apart">Just Enough Research by Erika Hall</a> (second edition). A cornerstone for anyone who wants to design the right thing for their clients. Useful and witty.</p>

<p class="detached">ðŸ”— <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41584982-dove-mi-trovo" title="Check the book on Goodreads">Dove mi trovo by Jhumpa Lahiri</a>. My favourite author, who now writes in Italian too. This is her first Italian novel, out in English as <em>Whereabouts</em>. Iâ€™m devouring this short book where her classic themes of attachment and estrangement, nostalgia and solitude are at their peak.</p>

## What Iâ€™m watching

<p class="detached">ðŸ”— <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2575988/" title="Check the series on IMDB">Silicon Valley</a>. A TV series friends recommended years ago, that I watched only recently. Six brief series where a group of developers tries to build their start-up. Loads of laughing-out-loud moments, and a few annoying ones. Blink and itâ€™s the series finale, with nostalgia and a hint of sadness.</p>

<p class="detached">ðŸ”— <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7772588/" title="Check the series on IMDB">For All Mankind</a> (Apple TV +). What would have happened if the Soviets landed on the moon first? This series is a well done dystopia. Initially, I thought it was light entertainment but it confronts current themes in a clever way. The second season is available, a third is on the way.</p>

<p class="detached">ðŸ”— <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5363618/" title="Check the series on IMDB">Sound of Metal</a>. The life of Ruben, a metal drummer, falls apart when he suddenly loses his hearing. I have yet to find the right words to describe this movie, and itâ€™s fine. All the awards and nominations received are well earned.</p>

## What surprised me

[A confirmation of how broken entrepreneurship is internationally](https://womensagenda.com.au/latest/the-tampon-removal-glove-created-by-men-that-got-investor-backing-is-an-example-of-a-broken-system/){:title="Read the article on Women's Agenda"}. A couple of men received backing for their idea that should help people that menstruate. What am I talking about? A pair of gloves â€“ pink, of course â€“ that should make the act of removing tampons less gross. Nope, we donâ€™t need it, thank you. They should have read Erika Hallâ€™s book.

As a person who likes almost everything digital and tech, I was surprised to read of the study that [suggests to use paper notebooks for information we need to learn or memorise](https://neurosciencenews.com/hand-writing-brain-activity-18069/){:title="Read the article on Neuroscience News"}. Noted.

Simone Bossi, an Italian photographer, explains why he thinks [digital photography is too much to digest](https://www.dezeen.com/2021/03/12/simone-bossi-architecture-photography-interview/){:title="Read the article on Dezeen"}. His approach is fascinating: even if now itâ€™s possible to take thousands of pictures of the same angle, he takes one. The pictures he took at the [Surrey Docks Farm](https://www.dezeen.com/2020/03/15/pup-architects-surrey-docks-farm-extension-architecture-london/){:title="Read the article on Dezeen"}, the place down the road we used to live in London, are precious.
