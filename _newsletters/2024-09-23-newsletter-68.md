For a long time after quitting Instagram in 2021, my photos were nowhere to be seen. Sometimes I would post a few pictures on my blog but it never felt quite right. I thought there had to be a reason to publish one or more pictures, or a similarity between them to build a story.

With infinite gratitude to [my husband Simone](https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/) for helping me so much, I am happy and proud to launch my new photography website, which will be designed in the open. The site is good enough to be online but there will be changes to the design and functionality in the future.

I hope you enjoy it!

See you soon,<br>
