Dear friend,

This email reaches you in its new and improved formula: plain text and no trackers. I wonâ€™t know if you opened it, nor if you clicked a link. Nobody will. Iâ€™m writing from a new address, and you might need to instruct your email client that this is not spam, or add the address to your contacts list, if you wish.

## Design, Digested 23

The new Design, Digested issue is about imposter syndrome, women in tech, and pockets. Did you ever feel like an imposter? Like you werenâ€™t qualified to do your job, or held back asking for a promotion for the same reason? I did. Itâ€™s a situation many people find themselves in, men and women alike, but that disproportionately affects certain minorities. 

This week I gathered articles that made me see this phenomenon from a different perspective. Time to reframe.
