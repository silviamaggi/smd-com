In this part of the world, spring is visible. We’re preparing the soil for the vegetables, and already planted mixed flowers for the bees. Our mint is growing strong, and there are more daffodils than we remembered. A pleasant surprise was to find the previous tenants’ lovely yellow tulips, which we are now enjoying.

Fauna-wise, there are a lot of cats visiting the garden. Also, foxes. This is new, as between 2015 and 2020 we never saw one. Neighbours said they had stopped seeing hedgehogs, so we were delighted when our camera caught one a few nights ago.

## New on the blog
Ana Rodrigues, who works as a front-end developer in London and has a website with lovely illustrations, wrote a post titled _You don't have to be a “content creator” to have a website_. It resonated with me, so I replied with my considerations.

A few days later, Juha-Matti Santala picked up our posts and [added his thoughts on his blog](https://hamatti.org/posts/on-content-creation-and-personal-web/). This is the indieweb, and I love it. 

## Design, Digested 52
This issue marks the beginning of a different type of series, where I mostly share blog posts from people writing on their personal websites.

- Digital design is conflicted
