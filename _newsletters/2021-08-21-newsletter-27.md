Dear Friend,

This letter comes to you from sweltering southern Europe. While I try not to think about how warm the next few nights might be, I wrote a couple of things. The first one is the newest instalment of the *Design, Digested* series. As I told you in my last letter, I started sharing the UX and design resources that made me reflect most.

<p class="detached">The second one is an announcement to my WordPress followers. This might not interest you directly, but I decided to leave the platform. My website will have a new house, look, and ways to be managed. Iâ€™ll write more about this but, for now, suffice to say that my intent is to simplify and lighten.</p>

<p class="detached">Thatâ€™s all from me,<br>
Hoping youâ€™re well!
