Hi!

January is already drawing to an end and the list of subjects I want to write about needs to become shorter.

If youâ€™re into both sustainability and accessibility, stop everything youâ€™re doing and read Tom Greenwoodâ€™s article on the advent of green accessibility. Find it on the new _Design, Digested_ together with:

- The state of mobile user experience;
- The technology of compassion;
- Atkinson Hyperlegible font;
- Life, the UX-verse and everything.

The accessibility project with Italyâ€™s top bank ended suddenly. The decision came out of the blue a few days before Christmas. (Iâ€™m on a different project for a different client now.)

See you soon,
