Hi!

A couple of weeks ago, after the last newsletter sent from Mailchimp, I wrote one that only a few of you received. Sorry for the inconvenience! It was about viewing imposter syndrome from a different perspective. If you didn't receive it, <a href="https://silviamaggidesign.com/newsletter/archive/newsletter-33/">check it out in the archive</a>. If you're interested in a psychologist's point of view on the matter, watch Delta CX's podcast with Dr. Seth Finkle.
