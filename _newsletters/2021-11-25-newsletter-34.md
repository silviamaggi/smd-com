<p class="lead">Teething problems.</p>

<!--more-->

Hi!

I've had some teething problems with the new version of the newsletter, so I hope this email reaches you. Months went by and it's almost time to book the booster, but the situation in Europe is not promising. I wrote a bit about this in the latest Weeknotes.

## Design, Digested 24

Last summer, we spent some time with friends in a small seaside town. One of the friends has disabilities, and a few people built a ramp for her to reach the veranda from the yard and viceversa. She insisted the ramp would benefit everyone, not just her. She is right. It's a phenomenon called the curb-cut effect.

Find out what are the eight items that were built for people with disabilities, but are regularly used by everyone, in the new issue. Also included:

<ul class="smd-ul">
  <li>How designers can prevent user errors</li>
  <li>How creepy is that device</li>
  <li>Users adapting to technology that wasn't designed with them in mind</li>
</ul>
