Hi!

Have you ever thought where would your content â€“ thoughts, interactions, photos â€“ go if the platform you published it on suddenly closed? Youâ€™ll probably have the time to download and save it, but the truth is that itâ€™ll disappear. 

I miss my Instagram curated gallery, which I feel like it was a good way to documenting my life. I joined [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org "Visit the Pixelfed website"), the federated answer to Instagram, but donâ€™t feel the need to post.  Iâ€™ve been thinking for a while how to recreate the gallery-as-documentation on a website thatâ€™s mine and no one elseâ€™s. Iâ€™m taking my time with this, and will be working on it with clearer plans in the future. 

Meanwhile, Iâ€™ve spent a considerable amount of time downloading the contents of an expensive photography course I bought a few years ago. Whatever happens, I need to be able to access it, even without an internet connection. When companies decide to build a closed system, that works only when people are online, they choose to build barriers: just like in the physical world, a good chunk of population will struggle to access it.
