Dear Friends,

I have a few things to share with you this week. When I wrote the post about the Ravelry redesign, I knew it was important to offer a UX designer point of view on the matter. But I didnâ€™t expect the attention it received. Iâ€™m glad many found it useful, and grateful to everyone who took the time to read and share it. In case you missed the post, find it here:
