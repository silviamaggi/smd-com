Dear Friends,

All I read this week revolves around two main areas: how we can get absorbed into our phones and social media, and how **AI and algorithms are supposed to be neutral but are a mirror to our society**. Itâ€™s a loop that we might not even realise is there. Hereâ€™s what I share with you today:

<ul class="smd-ul">
  <li>What would the future look like if algorithms that command our daily interactions were developed based on feminist values?</li>
  <li>Biased AI perpetuates racial injustice.</li>
  <li>Time to tidy up our digital waste.</li>
  <li>Your phone is designed to be addicting.</li>
  <li>Ten arguments for deleting your social media accounts right now.</li>
</ul>

<p class="detached">Enjoy!<br>
Silvia</p>
