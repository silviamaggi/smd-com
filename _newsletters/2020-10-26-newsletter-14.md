Dear Friend,

After a two-monthÂ [hiatus](https://silviamaggidesign.com/photography/after-the-rain/), the design inspiration series is back. This week, the focus is on issues with the moderation of social media content, how products get complicated and how a few companies are redesigning capitalism.

<p class="detached">I hope you enjoy it!<br>
