Dear Friend,

It feels like a long time since I last was in your inbox, and it probably is. I even forgot to tell you when [Design, Digested 13]({{ site.url }}/design-digested/ai-bias-and-enzo-mari-legacy/) was out. The new edition of the digest has a deeper meaning, though. 

As 25 November marked the *International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women*, I gathered a few articles for you to gauge the current situation. Spoiler alert: itâ€™s bad. The pandemic intensified violence against women and girls, which is why I believe itâ€™s more important than ever for everyone to join the conversation and spread the word. 

Make sure to visit the UN website and check the *Orange the World* campaign â€“ itâ€™s the first link in the digest. Thank you!
