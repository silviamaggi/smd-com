I havenâ€™t been satisfied with _Design, Digested_ for some time. The intention of being consistent has often been disregarded because of other commitments, tiredness or lack of inspiration. I felt guilty because I wasnâ€™t sticking to my self-imposed schedule, and went against my principle of consuming less online content for better mental health.

Itâ€™s time to declare this series irregular and, most importantly, Iâ€™m trying a new format. I will share fewer articles, while adding a brief introduction explaining my take.

## Design, Digested 48

- Culture influences design
- UX for older adults
- Bad use of AI
