Hi!

Ever since the new year started, Iâ€™ve been reading a lot. I built a library on my laptop including the digital versions of the physical books that still lie in the garage after we moved, the ones I bought on the Kobo store and the ones I read in the past and wish to keep.

The library has become one of my most treasured collections. As it happens too often with digital stuff, though, I didnâ€™t have a precise idea of how many books I own and how many Iâ€™ve read. Now I know that I read too little over the past ten years. 
Iâ€™m going to tell you what books I finished, because once the information is out there, I canâ€™t go back to not reading, can I?

Finished, and liked a lot:

- _Pigeon English_, by Stephen Kelman
- _The Essex Serpent_, by Sarah Perry
- _Women & Power_, by Mary Beard

In progress:

- _Extra Bold â€“ A Feminist, Inclusive, Anti-racist, Nonbinary Field Guide for Graphic Designers_, by Ellen Lupton, Farah Kafei, Jennifer Tobias, Josh A. Halstead, Kaleena Sales, Leslie Xia, Valentina Vergara
- _Stories of Your Life and Others_, by Ted Chiang
- _The Norfolk Mystery_, by Ian Sansom

Ideally, _Extra Bold_ would be on my tea table, opened on one of its many insightful pages. I quoted two of them recently: one [about history](https://silviamaggidesign.com/notes/note-history/), the other [about stereotypes (or clichÃ©s)](https://silviamaggidesign.com/notes/note-about-stereotypes/). 

Another important thing I did was deleting all occurrences of the adjective â€™darkâ€™ when used to describe deceptive patterns on my website, in a bid to be more inclusive and not discriminatory.
