Itâ€™s fair to say that summer is over in the UK. The tank in the garden still has water, which means that the sunny days havenâ€™t been enough, and that it has rained a lot. Weâ€™ve eaten delicious romanesco courgettes and their flowers, rocket salad, and are now enjoining our plum tomatoes. Inevitably, however, the garden will soon have to be cleaned up to be ready for the colder seasons.

Iâ€™m happy we had a brilliant weekend. The weather was lovely and, with our visiting friend, we followed in the footsteps of  Virginia Woolf and the Neo-Pagans from the Cambridge city centre to Byronâ€™s Pool in Grantchester. It was a pleasant 7-kilometre walk in the countryside. We rewarded ourselves with a rich Caesar salad, and some well-deserved rest at [The Orchard Tea Garden](https://www.theorchardteagarden.co.uk).

## Summer readings

Since June I read and loved:

- _Frankenstein_, by Mary Shelley
- _Poor Things_, by Alasdair Gray
- _The Vanishing Act of Esme Lennox_, by Maggie Oâ€™Farrell

Iâ€™m currently reading _Aliceâ€™s Adventures in Wonderland_, by Lewis Carroll, for the first time in English, and are very much looking forward to [_Julia_, by Sandra Newman](https://www.harperacademic.com/book/9780063265332/julia/) â€“ a retelling of George Orwellâ€™s _1984_.

### Silvia Maggi Photography

Since I haven't updated my Flickr account in years, and have abandoned social media for good, my photos are nowhere to be seen. Itâ€™s ironic for someone who lists photography as one of her greatest passions. Some time ago I announced my intention to build a photography website. Now I can say that I have finally designed it and am building it.

Watch this space for the launch.

## New on the website
This post is long overdue. I started writing it several times but I have never been focused enough to do it. As with writing on my blog, also my ukulele practise has slowed down.
