During the past few months, I went through a crisis and asked for help. I discovered facts about myself that made me reconsider my past from a different perspective.

One of the consequences is that an idea that's been brewing for some time finally feels right. I'm stepping away from UX. As I do so, without knowing where this journey will take me professionally, it also makes sense to stop this newsletter.

Design is still a strong interest of mine. It is a vast subject that touches on many areas. Though, I won't be writing about UX for the time being. The _Design, Digested_ series will resume at some point, taking a different shape. However, the newsletter won't be coming back.

I will delete the subscribers' email addresses from my archives.
