Dear Friend,

It’s time for another change. **My new, independent and tracking-free website was just the beginning**. Next, this newsletter. I’ve been looking for alternatives to Mailchimp that don’t track you, ending up choosing my current email provider, with the website to host subscription form and newsletter archive.

From your point of view, nothing should change. The biggest difference is that I will be storing your email address instead of some company. Rest assured that I will never give your address to third parties, nor send you spam. Your data is safe with me and *ProtonMail*, the Swiss secure email service with built-in end-to-end encryption I’ve been using for almost two years. <a href="https://protonmail.com/" title="Visit the ProtonMail website">Know more about the service here</a> (not sponsored).

My next email to you will use the new system. In the meantime, you have a few choices: leave everything as it is, change your email address, unsubscribe. Use the links at the bottom of this email, and I will make the changes. In case you wish to communicate directly with me, write at: <a href="mailto:newsletter@silviamaggidesign.com" title="Write me an email">newsletter@silviamaggidesign.com</a>

<p class="detached">I hope to see you on the other side!<br>
<br>
Silvia</p>
