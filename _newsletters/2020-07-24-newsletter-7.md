Dear Friends,

Something important took space in my mind during the past week: web accessibility. In a moment when people spend more time at home and need to be and feel connected, we realise what a privilege it is to have a good internet connection. Tim Berners-Lee, who invented the World Wide Web, made it clearer than ever: [access to the internet should be a universal right](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/04/covid-19-internet-universal-right-lockdown-online). But it doesnâ€™t stop there: websites need to be accessible to everyone, regardless of disability. It seems surreal to have to say this in 2020, but **a website designed with accessibility in mind benefits everyone**.

Last month, the well-know among knitters and crocheters website Ravelry underwent a redesign of the interface. It was a surprise for everyone, especially for the ones that started to experience physical issues while or after browsing it. At the same time, screen reader software stopped working, effectively blocking a group of people from accessing the site. I wrote a blog post about this detailing what happened and explaining what are the best practices, from a UX Design point of view. Youâ€™ll also find some useful articles if youâ€™re interested in knowing more. 

In the meantime, Ravelry didnâ€™t fix the accessibility issues. Moreover, the founders and team closed or made private their social media accounts, and closed the threads about the redesign on the forum: not a good sign of the things to come. Itâ€™s up to us, designers and developers, to build accessible websites. Itâ€™s up to all of us to call out companies that donâ€™t do it. **Itâ€™s our responsibility to make the web accessible, usable and inclusive**.
