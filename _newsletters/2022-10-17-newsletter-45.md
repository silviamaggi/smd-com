Hi!

Yesterday has been an eventful day. We had our fourth anti-COVID vaccination, and saw a photography exhibition dedicated to a selection of work by Elliot Erwitt. Itâ€™s been a pleasant experience, which reminded me of the last time I saw an exhibition. It was on 18 February 2017, the Saturday I traveled to London from Cambridge to see The Radical Eye exhibition at Tate Modern. It featured almost 200 modernist photographs from Elton Johnâ€™s vast collection. A long time ago.

The new _Design, Digested_ features a rich bunch of interesting articles about accessibility, the history of user interfaces, carbon footprinting, climate crisis and more. Youâ€™ll find also a TED video titled â€˜I listen to colorâ€™.

I hope you enjoy it!


Take care,  
Silvia
