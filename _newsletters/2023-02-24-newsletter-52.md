Hi!

Design, Digested might become a weekly appointment again, so Iâ€™ll go straight to the point.

Ever since my last email to you â€“ and after reaching for my stash of yarn in the wake of a long hiatus â€“ I wrote a short post about [the story of how and why I started knitting](https://silviamaggidesign.com/personal/back-to-knitting/).

The other news is that I have a now page. An idea by Derek Sivers, a now page tells what a person is focused on at this point in their life. It also tells of a personâ€™s goals, which I highlighted for no other reason than to avoid losing sight of them. [Visit my now page](https://silviamaggidesign.com/now/).

## Design, Digested 40

On this issue:

- Tools for better thinking
- Digital ethics and moral theory explained
