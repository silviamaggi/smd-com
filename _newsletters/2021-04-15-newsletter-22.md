Dear Friend,

The last two weeks have been intense, but I finally feel satisfied. In my last letter, I told you about my plan to have another case study published and the website tweaked. Iâ€™m not sure where this energy comes from, but I did everything and something more. Before taking a short break to recharge my batteries, let me share the latest with you.

Reminiscing about the work done for UniCredit Bank years ago **boosted my confidence**. If you have the time to read it, I hope you enjoy it.

<p class="detached"><em>After 1989: A trip to freedom</em> is my husband Simoneâ€™s debut solo album, and an emotional journey. I documented it with pictures and created two music videos.</p>

<p class="detached">At the beginning of the month, weâ€™ve enjoyed very mild temperatures. Now itâ€™s cold again, but the flowers donâ€™t care about that. The wisteria in the yard is blooming.</p>
