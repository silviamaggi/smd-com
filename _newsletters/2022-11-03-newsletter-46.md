Hi!

I made a few great discoveries while staying at my parentsâ€™. One is a book I bought in 2001 from a Bouquiniste in Paris, plus the train tickets kept inside it as memento â€” that I of course forgot about. The other is a Swatch watch I used to wear everyday in my early twenties â€“ thatâ€™s roughly twenty years ago â€“ that my mom decided to keep.

Sometimes when talking about the years spent in the UK, I get frustrated because I canâ€™t remember some placesâ€™ names, or an eventâ€™s date. There are pictures, but the record itself is gone. I started keeping a journal more than a year ago, because I couldnâ€™t rely on social media to keep my memories. Itâ€™s been a great decision for me, even if I donâ€™t write every day.

A few articles on The Guardian recently got me obsessed with [Alan Rickmanâ€™s diaries](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/oct/12/madly-deeply-the-alan-rickman-diaries-review-inside-the-actors-world). He started keeping them in 1993, up until his death in 2015. Theyâ€™re an absolute pleasure to read: fun, witty, especially his film reviews. What fascinates me is the care that goes into keeping a journal. Itâ€™s also an editing effort: what you write is what you want to remember, the rest can be forgotten.

This is the spirit that made me keep a work diary as well. To wrap up the first month of work as accessibility consultant for one of Italy's major banks, I shared a few things I learned. Itâ€™s the first of a series of at least three â€“ the length of my contract as of now.
