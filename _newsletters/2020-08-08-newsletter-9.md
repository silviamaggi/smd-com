Dear Friends,

This weekâ€™s email reaches you later than usual. On Friday, my blog was offline most of the day while my husband moved it to a self-hosted domain. We sweated over some technical issues, or was it because of the <code>34&deg;C</code> temperature in Cambridge? You might wonder why this is important. My website is my online home and, while I take a break from social media, I want it tidy and working for when youâ€™ll visit. Iâ€™m keeping a diary to record the progress of the break and will share it as soon as it feels complete. A preview: itâ€™s not easy.Â 

I [took a picture](https://silviamaggidesign.com/photography/today-i-saw/)Â and published it on my site instead of Instagram. I miss the time when, before social media, our thoughts werenâ€™t scattered on various platforms.Â 

On this weekâ€™s digest, **I gathered a few interesting resources about inclusive design, accessibility and problematic facts about social media**. See where Iâ€™m going? At the end of the digest â€“ thank you for reading â€“ youâ€™ll find something different than usual. Itâ€™s a music video that links the nuclear attack on Hiroshima to a touching personal story.
