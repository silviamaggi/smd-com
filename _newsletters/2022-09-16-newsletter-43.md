Hi!

In my last email I stated the intention to publish the _Design, Digested_ series more frequently. It didnâ€™t happen. Iâ€™ve been both busy and in a state of suspension as the exciting project Iâ€™ve been involved in has yet to start. 

The past month has also been important from a personal point of view, as my husband and I decided to go back to the UK. If you know me personally, or have followed our adventures, youâ€™re aware of the disillusion we experienced with Brexit and what followed. Then the pandemic gave us reasons to leave and join our families in Italy.

Circumstances change, though, and Iâ€™m cautiously contented to go back to the place where we both have many good memories and friends. More on this later.

In the meantime, as I took a closer look to the WCAG 2.1 success criteria, I decided to take a step-by-step approach to make my website entirely accessible. This is the first of a series of posts where I explain the changes Iâ€™m making and why.

I listened to a very interesting episode of UX Podcast about UX sitemaps. You read it right. Buffled? Surprised?

Having recently started contracting for an Italian web agency, I worried my focus was going to go anywhere except where it was needed. Punctually, it happened. What I do to better my mental and physical health.
