I left my job at the end of 2019 with the intention of taking a few months to update my knowledge of UX, find a job in Sweden and start a new life. We all know what happened in 2020.

Fast-forward to today, I live in Italy and recently reviewed the content of [my website](https://silviamaggidesign.com/) to return to my origins. I'm *a web designer and developer focused on usability, accessibility and information architecture*. The entire site reflects that statement now. My [projects page](https://silviamaggidesign.com/projects/) is filled with both past work and my side projects, without separation.

It's the natural progression of a process that started when I built my website to contain my digital life. With the latest change I stopped projecting an identity instead of my authentic self.

## What's new

A lot. Let me give you some directions. 

### Design, Digested #28

Discover the designers misguided concerns about disabled bodies; the future of accessibility standards; the infinite scroll effect; the influence of 80s cult phemon Max Headroom and more.

### The changing season

Same landscape, never the same. My daily commute by bicycle documented using a phone camera between 2016-2017 in Cambridge, UK.
