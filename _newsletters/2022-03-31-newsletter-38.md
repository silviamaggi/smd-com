Hi!

As itâ€™s been a long time since the last _Design, Digested_, I prepared a very rich edition. It contains everything I found interesting in the past two months, from false empathy in design to a beautiful photo project, via the sustainability of fast fashion and how the design community is responding to the invasion of Ukraine.

## Other news

I joined [Mastodon](https://indieweb.social/web/@silviamaggi){: title="Visit my Mastodon profile"}, the community-owned, ad-free and decentralised social network. On there, my article about [quitting social media](https://silviamaggidesign.com/personal/life-off-social-media/){: title="Read my article about what happened when I quit mainstream social media"} really took off â€“ the irony, right? So far, so good: itâ€™s a quieter place than Twitter, and the absence of algorithms is refreshing. Letâ€™s see how this experiment goes.

I resumed my [Drawabox](https://silviamaggidesign.com/drawing/learning-to-draw/){: title="Read about my learning to draw journey"} exercises and liked the film [Toc Toc](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6060156/){: title="Read about the film on IMDB"} so much I started learning Spanish.
