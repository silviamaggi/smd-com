Dear friends, 

It feels like something is moving in the right direction. At least online, a lot of people are interested in listening to black people. But will there be changes in our day-to-day lives? As far as Iâ€™m concerned, **the design community is, for the vast majority, white**. Itâ€™s undeniable that white people designed society as it is now. As a consequence, the world is not intended for everyone. Now itâ€™s up to us to voice our concern within our organisations: we cannot design for inclusion if our teams are not diverse. 

IBM made a bold move against racially biased surveillance, but will other companies follow? This week also saw *Quaker Oats* and *Mars* announcing a branding review for *Aunt Jemima*, *Uncle Ben* and others. 
I was delighted to see a video from 1983, where David Bowie scolded MTV for not playing videos by black artists. His unimpressed gaze must have hurt! Also this week: structure helps both creativity and productivity. Ian Fleming had an interesting work routine that helped him write *Casino Royale*.
