<p class="lead">White, middle-class males designed the world, for themselves.</p>

<!--more-->

Dear friends,Â 

It is clear by now that **the tech industry has a diversity problem**. As humans, we tend to group with people who look like us and share our interests, so itâ€™s not surprisingÂ to find out that straight, white, middle-class males designed products whichÂ reflectÂ themselves. The design industry is *71% white*; therefore, when teams are not diverse, the products they build are biased.

To design for everyone, we need to consider the usersâ€™ context, hence, why we need professionalsÂ that can empathise with them. We need people to call us out on our assumptions. Data is already biased against women, as a powerful and provocative book reveals, so changeÂ must beÂ happening now, a moment where algorithmsÂ andÂ AIÂ are becoming more prominent in our lives.Â These, and other intriguing topics â€” including a funny video about poorly designed doors â€” is what youâ€™ll find in this weekâ€™s digest.Â
