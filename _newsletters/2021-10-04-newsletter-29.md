Dear Friend,

I’m writing from Milan, where I moved two days ago. It’ll take me a while to get used to the city I lived in for eight years: everything is bigger and noisier than what I’ve become used to. The perfect word to describe the past two weeks is *dizziness*. I documented everything with two new posts, and restarted *Design, Digested*:

<ul class="smd-ul">
  <li><a href="https://silviamaggidesign.com/photography/back-to-the-lake/">Back to the lake</a> – photography;</li>
  <li><a href="https://silviamaggidesign.com/design-digested/design-digested-20/">Design, Digested 20: Gender-neutral language</a>;</li>
  <li><a href="https://silviamaggidesign.com/weeknotes/weeknotes-1-dizziness/">Week 1: Dizziness</a> – a new series where I tell you about my week.</li>
</ul>

Enjoy!  
Silvia
