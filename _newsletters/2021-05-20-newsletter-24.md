Dear Friend,

I’m writing to you today in occasion of [the tenth Global Accessibility Awareness Day (GAAD)](https://globalaccessibilityawarenessday.org/). The purpose of GAAD is to get everyone talking, thinking and learning about digital access/inclusion and people with different disabilities. And that’s what I’m doing. I hope the articles I’m sharing with you in this letter will help you think and talk about accessibility, not just once a year. But first, did you know what are the most common causes of accessibility failure of websites (home pages in this case)?

<p class="detached">Look around you: how many places, activities, web sites are not accessible? I don’t have a number in mind, but my guess is <em>a lot</em>. Think about it, talk about it and, if you can, do something.</p>
