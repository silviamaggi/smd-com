A person trying to fight information overload got me thinking about my own situation. My inbox is drowning in a sea of unread emails, while I’m often unable to go through the ever-growing reading list for the _Design, Digested_ series.

My motivation to continue the series is to gather the most significant articles and share them. But it takes time and energy to concile it with work. At this point of the year, I need to slow down.

_Design, Digested_ goes on holiday while I clear my mind, reading list, and think about what’s next.

In the meantime, I managed to write three posts I had left behind for too long:

- [My temporary disability and how I coped with it]({{ site.url }}/accessibility/my-temporary-disability/)
- [The vicious flower and the news]({{ site.url }}/personal/vicious-flower-news/)
- [Letting go of my Duolingo streak]({{ site.url }}/personal/letting-go-duolingo-streak/)

Have a great summer,<br>
