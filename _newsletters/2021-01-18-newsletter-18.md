Dear Friend,

Iâ€™m back in your mailbox after a long pause.Â There have been some changes. Some I planned, others that naturally followed.Â First, I deleted my Facebook account. Then, more surprisingly, I decided it was time to let go of my Instagram account, too. I deactivated it.Â 

Itâ€™s probably a counter-productive move, but itâ€™s been a long time since I felt so light. I wrote an article about this. I hope youâ€™ll find it interesting:

<p class="detached">What about you, are you okay?</p>

<p class="detached">See you soon,<br>
Silvia</p>
