Dear Friend,

I’m back in your mailbox after a long pause. There have been some changes. Some I planned, others that naturally followed. First, I deleted my Facebook account. Then, more surprisingly, I decided it was time to let go of my Instagram account, too. I deactivated it. 

It’s probably a counter-productive move, but it’s been a long time since I felt so light. I wrote an article about this. I hope you’ll find it interesting:

<p class="detached">What about you, are you okay?</p>

<p class="detached">See you soon,<br>
Silvia</p>
