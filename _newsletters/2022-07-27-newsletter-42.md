Hi!

During this sweltering summer, I will start working on a very exciting project – more on this later. _Design, Digested_ won’t take a break this year: I felt very inconsistent with my publications lately, and hope to go back to the originally intended pace.

The new issue starts with _Distracted to death_, a striking podcast episode about how today’s automobiles overload our brains’ cognitive abilities to a very dangerous point. In it, you can hear Emily Schubert, Senior Engineering Manager for Car Experience at Apple, talking about how they worked with automakers to reinvent the in-car experience. Is that a real need? Or is people’s safety being sacrificed just because it is possible to design such systems? Also in the latest issue:

- Where’s the button? Designing for mode confusion
- The “dark yellow problem” in design system color palettes
- The Metaverse pretends that life is a game. That’s the whole problem
- Instagram gets worse with dark patterns lifted from TikTok
- Could sustainable websites increase energy consumption?
- ‘I’ve taken a million pictures – 50 were good’: photographer Ferdinando Scianna
