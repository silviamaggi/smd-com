Dear Friend,

It feels like a long time since I last wrote to you. Maybe it is. Iâ€™ve been adjusting to life in Milan, the city I previously lived in for eight years. When people ask me whatâ€™s coming next, I still donâ€™t have an answer. I can only take baby steps in what seems the right direction.

<p class="detached">I prepared the new instalment of <em>Design, Digested</em>, which you can read below. It includes:</p>

<ul class="smd-ul">
  <li>When our hormones work against us.</li>
  <li>UX designâ€™s dirty secret.</li>
  <li>Dark patterns.</li>
  <li>Designing our circular future.</li>
</ul>

<p class="detached">ðŸ”— Read <a href="https://silviamaggidesign.com/design-digested/design-digested-22/">Design, Digested 22: the Hook model and UX designâ€™s dirty secret</a></p>

<p class="detached">I kept writing weekly notes: in fact, they grew in numbers since my last letter. You might have missed:</p>

<ul class="smd-ul">
  <li>Week 3: Looking around.</li>
  <li>Week 4: Kalles.</li>
  <li>Week 5: Changed.</li>
</ul>
