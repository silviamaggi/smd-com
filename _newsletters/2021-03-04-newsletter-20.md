Dear Friend,

It is a sunny, mild day today in Emilia-Romagna. We’ve been enjoining higher temperatures lately, so much so we had a barbeque before stricter restrictions came into place in our area. Ever since we moved back, almost everything is a sensory experience that brings back memories of my childhood, and reminds me of things I didn’t know I missed. This is particularly true with food. I often have *Anton Ego* moments.
