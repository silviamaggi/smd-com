Hi!

Do you ever wonder where do all the social media posts end up once they’re published? “I wish it were a blog post” is what I think every time I see an interesting one. This is partly what inspired a new project, which wasn’t initially conceived to be public.

## New project

My work as a designer entails paying attention to my surroundings and take notes. The digital and physical interactions I encounter inform what I will design next.

Without an archive, I ended up with my phone and laptop full of out of context screenshots that don’t mean much.

I’ve created a vault in Obsidian to gather good and bad user experiences. Then, [Simone](https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/) suggested I publish them on GitHub. That’s where you’ll find them — work in progress.

## Design, Digested #44 — UX of a monopoly, Sabbath mode, buttons

On this issue: 

- Ticketmaster: the UX of a true monopoly
- Has design become too dogmatic?
- Should the confirmation button come first or last?
- Design patterns for mental health
- Sabbath mode and assistive technology features
- Language, please
