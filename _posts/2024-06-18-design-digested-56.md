## We need to rewild the internet

> Our online spaces are not ecosystems, though tech firms love that word. Theyâ€™re plantations; highly concentrated and controlled environments, closer kin to the industrial farming of the cattle feedlot or battery chicken farms that madden the creatures trapped within.

They draw a beautiful parallel between the internet and a healthy forest, indicating a framework and a plan on how to get there. A long, insightful and hopeful read that I thoroughly enjoyed.
