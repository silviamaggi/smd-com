A photo, a post, a video, a podcast. These are among the things that are now called ‘content’ on social media. You create content and present it to your followers the right way, at the right time. Have you tried monetise it? Well, wouldn’t it be great to be paid to do what you love? It became common thinking that turning your hobbies into profit is a great idea.

Except, when you do, they become something you _have_ to do with consistency, no matter what, to be relevant. Capitalism wants you to be always productive, and that is reflected on social media.

As Ana suggests, there is another way to be found on the web: by getting a website. It doesn’t have to be anything complex, just give people a way to contact you. The rest comes later, and is totally under your control.
