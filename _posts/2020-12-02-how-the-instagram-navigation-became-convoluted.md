With the introduction of significant layout changes – the tabs Reel and Shop – the Instagram navigation became convoluted. Let’s briefly explore how.

## The reason

[Announcing the changes](https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/introducing-reels-and-shop-tabs){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, Adam Mosseri, Head of Instagram, pointed out how the pandemic changed the way people use the app. Short and entertaining videos became prominent, and people started buying more online.

**Young people** and **creators** are at the centre of Instagram’s focus, which is the reason behind the positioning of the two new tabs in the bottom navigation.

## The science

For a person holding a phone with one hand, the bottom area is **easier to reach** with the thumb. Anything at the top, considering the increasing sizes of modern phones, is impossible to touch without readjusting the phone.

## The convoluted navigation

### Activity

For the _Reel_ and _Shop_ tabs to be quick and **easy to access**, _New Post_ and _Activity_ had to be moved to the top of the screen. _New Post_ is on both the home page and profile page, while _Activity_ is only accessible from the home page.

Being able to access _Activity_ exclusively from one page means **more taps** and more chances of getting **lost** or **distracted** before reaching it. One could argue that the in-app notifications won’t make you miss a comment or like, but people might wish to easily go back and reply at a later moment.

As mentioned earlier, the _Create New_ feature is now at the top. What I find confusing is how the **nature** of the **feature** changes based on its position within the app.

### Home

From the home screen, people can create **four** types of content – _Post_ being the default – by choosing from a sliding menu at the bottom of the page, which I initially didn’t notice: _Post_, _Story_, _Reel_, _Live_.

### Profile

From the profile, people can create **six** types of content: _Feed Post_, _Story_, _Highlight_, _IGTV Video_, _Reel_, _Guide_.

## One possible explanation

Instagram may be **testing** which one of the _similar-but-different_ features performs best. The reason I say this is that the layouts are too different to think they both fit the app. Moreover, it’s good UX practise to test between **two solutions**.

If this is the case, we’ll find out soon.

In the meantime, if you updated the app and felt lost, know that it’s not you. At the moment, the navigation is **genuinely convoluted**.

## Conclusions

The products we design or use can get **complicated** over time, mainly when they become established. It happens when users ask for more **features** or when they **change** the way they use it.  
See [Design, Digested #12 – Struggling with growth](https://silviamaggidesign.com/2020/10/26/design-digested-12-social-media-issues-complicated-products-and-redesigning-capitalism/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

Sometimes it happens when the **business model** changes: if the goal is to keep people **engaged** – and watching reels and looking for things to buy do it – then these actions need to take **priority** on the screen.
