<ul class="smd-ul">
  <li>Last week, I successfully sent out my newsletter without using Mailchimp. My previous attempt didn't work: some people received it, while others didn't. Read <a href="https://silviamaggidesign.com/newsletter/archive/newsletter-33/">Design, Digested 23: Imposter syndrome and pockets</a> if you missed it.</li>
  <li>Christmas doesn't appeal to me much, with one exception: I can't resist a quirky, heartwarming, Scandinavian TV shows. Last year I watched both series of the Norwegian <em>Home for Christmas</em>, while I recently enjoyed the Swedish <em>Love & Anarchy</em>. Watching them is like drinking mulled vine to me.</li>
  <li>Because of my French studies, I felt nostalgia for an early 2000s film: <em>L'auberge espagnole</em> — also known as <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0283900/"><em>Pot Luck</em></a> — so we watched it again. A French student spends a year in Barcelona, living with other six people from all over Europe. It's a messy, lovable, melting pot that perfectly represents the European Union.</li>
  <li>On Saturday, we had a pizza in super chaotic <em>Porta Venezia</em> with a person whose work I admire. Speaking English again has been refreshing.</li>
  <li>We're going to have the Covid booster jab in two weeks.</li>
