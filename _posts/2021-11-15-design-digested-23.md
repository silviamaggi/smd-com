<p class="lead">Many times I had thought, said, and been told that I suffer from <em>imposter syndrome</em>. Many of my friends, mostly female, have said so too. This week, I gathered articles that made me see this phenomenon from a different perspective. Time to reframe.</p>

## Stop telling women they have imposter syndrome

> The answer to overcoming imposter syndrome is not to fix individuals but to create an environment that fosters a variety of leadership styles and in which diverse racial, ethnic, and gender identities are seen as just as professional as the current model, [&hellip;] “Eurocentric, masculine, and heteronormative.”

## A pioneer of digital design looks back on a defining era

Loretta Staples, a UI designer in the Eighties and Nineties, had a front-row seat to the rise of personal computing.

> Men, especially ones named Steve and Bill, get a lot of credit for heralding this modern era of information technology. But behind the scenes, at tech and design firms around the world, the look and feel of those screens was defined by lesser-known graphic designers — people who created the windows, dialogue boxes and icons taken largely for granted these days.
