Despite what some people think about the British weather, we enjoy a beautiful kind of light in our living room at home – also in winter. The trees just ouside our garden, the wind, and the sun, come together to create amazing displays. Sometimes I capture them of videos, which I never publish. They’re private snapshots of moments I don’t want to forget.

I savour the melancholy and stillness that these displays evoke. Look long enough, though, and you know the time is passing, the world turning. I figured probably that’s why I liked so much the film [_After Yang_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8633464/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_5_nm_3_q_after%2520yang){: title="Opens the film entry on IMDb" }.
