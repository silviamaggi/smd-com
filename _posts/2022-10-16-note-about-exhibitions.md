excerpt: "Today we saw '100 Fotografie', the photography exhibition dedicated to a selection of work by Elliot Erwitt."

There were many famous shots and some others I never saw before. Overall, it's been a pleasant experience: we smiled a lot, as Erwitt's work is often amusing. It was quick though. We also skipped most of the descriptions provided because it didn't feel like they added anything important to the already eloquent photos.

Inevitably, I thought about the last time I saw a photography exhibition. It was on 18 February 2017, the Saturday I traveled to London from Cambridge to see _The Radical Eye_ exhibition at Tate Modern. It featured almost 200 modernist photographs from Elton John's vast collection. A long time ago.
