<p class="lead">With shorter and colder days, sometimes it's difficult to find the right time to go out and take some pictures.</p>

It is still too dark when commuting back from work, so I started taking pictures by night, even though I was never comfortable doing so. I wasn't sure my camera could handle the low light conditions very well, and probably my hands weren't steady enough to avoid bringing a tripod.

Whatever the result, I enjoyed trying. When it's darker, the world slows down a bit, even in very busy crossroads. Thanks to [Justin Carey](https://justincarey.com/){:title="Go to Justin Carey's website"} whose talk at the Shutter Hub Open Exhibition in July 2016 convinced me &mdash; and everyone else in the room &mdash; that everything is more interesting at night.
