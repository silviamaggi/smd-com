I had never stopped thinking about what I lost the day a music teacher asked me to sing a lead part in the choir. I was six years old, shy, and terrified of being put in the spotlight. I quit the course. I was also learning to play the keyboard, rehearsing my favourite songs every day. 

The desire to play an instrument faded, but I remember being able to read simple written music by the time I was in middle school, while playing the customary flute. 

I love music, and can’t go by a few days without it. Yet, I grew up thinking only a certain kind of people could play instruments. The talented, or the ones who could afford private lessons. This misconception changed just a few days ago, when my ukulele was delivered. 

[Simone](https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/) suggested it as a good choice for size and approachable learning curve. Manuals and videos are generally tailored to right-handed players, which adds a level of complexity. However, writing down left-handed chord diagrams helps.

I’m loving every minute of the journey, aching fingertips included!
