Stop bastardizing design with false empathy, fast fashion and sustainability, gender pay gap, and more.

## Stop bastardizing design with false empathy
A long and necessary read that reclaims the concept of *empathy*, which is currently misunderstood and misused in the business world. 

>For empathy to be a successful part of design, it must not be an external reflection, but most decidedly an internal activity that leads to transformative action. Empathy in design is not something you have, it’s something you build. And it must be designed to hit all three levels of depth or it won’t work. Let me explain.

## How Shein beat Amazon at its own game — and reinvented fast fashion
_Rest of World_ spent six months investigating the new ultra-fast-fashion ecosystem where Shein, one of the world’s largest fashion companies, thrives.

>At the heart of these issues is Shein’s aggressive business model. Comparisons to fast-fashion giants like H&M miss the point: it’s more like Amazon, operating a sprawling online marketplace that brings together around 6,000 Chinese clothing factories.

## Ep 153, Hauls! Algorithms! Crazy Cheap! What Does Shein's Ultra Fast Model Mean for Sustainability?
Host Clare Press sits down with American journalists Meaghan Tobin and Louise Matsakis who, together with Wendy Chen, spent six months looking at the matter from every possible angle.

>And you thought Zara was fast fashion! Buckle up because new trends are landing daily if not hourly, as a new breed of online disruptor throws out thousands of styles a week to see what sticks. Brands like Boohoo, Pretty Little Thing and Fashion Nova are part of a new ultra-fast fashion era, but Shein is by far the biggest player.

## Two women, 120 miles, 120 years
A year-long photography project born from a collaboration between my good friend Vanessa and Eve. Their beautiful work is inspiring me to pick up the camera again.

> Choosing to reach outside their bubbles of isolation, 2 women who had never met have began an enriching and fascinating photographic collaboration. Although both living in the UK, they inhabit different worlds - Vanessa in the depths of rural Somerset and Eve 120 miles away slap bang in the middle of London - but they connected over the time of COVID through their photos and stories on Instagram.
