description: "Notes and pictures at the end of the longest and hottest summer of my life. A holiday in Italy."
excerpt: "Notes and photos at the end of summer."
---
The sea is roaring under the blue sky. Iâ€™m watching the waves breaking at the rock barriers from the window, as a cotton sweater comforts me. 

The last swim of the year happened on a windy day at the end of the longest and hottest summer of my life. It was brisk, and followed by lunch under the olive tree with good company and wine. 

I missed being so close to nature; and looking at panoramas as far as my eyes can see, without any obstacles.
