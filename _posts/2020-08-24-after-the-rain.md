Today, after the rain, I used the tripod to take a few short videos in the garden. With time, I will set up a YouTube channel to share them.

As _[Design, Digested](https://silviamaggidesign.com/?cat_ID=678){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}_ went on holiday with good reasons – read why in my [latest letter](https://us10.campaign-archive.com/?u=0c9027b00ef8ad1210adae70d&id=509de179c7){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} – I took time today to appreciate my surroundings after a rain shower.

During the last few weeks, I neglected taking care of my body and started to feel it. If there’s anything I desperately need now that I’m preparing to [go back to my home country](https://silviamaggidesign.com/2020/08/20/new-journey-new-blog/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, is to move and stretch my body to release the tension.

I’m writing this post after a short restorative yoga session and can feel the difference already.
