## 900 days of progress – UX of banking

## The Micropedia

> [def.] Microaggressions are everyday snubs and insults that marginalized groups face. They're often very subtle comments or actions that come from implicit bias and/or stereotypes. They might seem like a compliment (“You're beautiful for a transgender girl”), a harmless comment (“Where are you really from?”), or a subconscious action (crossing the street to avoid a racialized person).

A great resource to start recognising microaggression and understand their impact on people.
