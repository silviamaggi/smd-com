<p class="lead">Starting 12 December 2016, until 22 January 2017, one of my photos is part of the <em>Hot Numbers Open Exhibition</em> in Cambridge.</p>

Taken on a warm sunny day in May 2016, to me the photo represents contemplation and the somehow strange and unnatural feeling of being so close to a massive cruise.

It’s been printed on Kodak Metallic Paper, which renders both colour and monochrome photos beautifully. The exhibition includes beautiful photos, paintings and drawings, and I am very happy to be part of it.
