Taken on a warm sunny day in May 2016, to me the photo represents contemplation and the somehow strange and unnatural feeling of being so close to a massive cruise.

Itâ€™s been printed on Kodak Metallic Paper, which renders both colour and monochrome photos beautifully. The exhibition includes beautiful photos, paintings and drawings, and I am very happy to be part of it.
