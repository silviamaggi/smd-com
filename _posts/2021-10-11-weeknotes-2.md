<ul class="smd-ul">
  <li>On Tuesday, I went for an <em>aperitivo</em>, which is a concept I'm not used to anymore. We met at 19:45 and, because of Covid-19 rules, booked a table. It was a slightly late dinner to me.</li>
  <li>We're lucky to have a big park close to home, and took a walk there in the morning several times this week. On one occasion, I went on a see-saw and laughed like a child.</li>
  <li>Simone and I walked as far as <em>Porta Venezia</em> earlier this week to replace a small boiling pan that I burned. We've yet to reach the city centre.</li>
  <li>When I moved to Milan in May 2003, I was adventurous, unfazed by the chaos. Fast-forward to October 2021: the first time on the <em>Metro</em> felt like a dance lesson I couldn't follow.</li>
  <li>On Friday, we visited the newly built area called <a href="https://www.portanuova.com/it"><em>Portanuova</em></a>, and ate delicious dumplings in <em>Via Paolo Sarpi</em>, the centre of Milan's Chinatown. Everything looked both familiar and foreign at the same time: I struggled to understand where I was geographically.</li>
  <li>Walking back to the car, a scared rat run toward us on the zebra crossing.</li>
  <li>Yesterday, we walked along the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naviglio_Martesana"><em>Naviglio della Martesana</em></a>, where we encountered a few cute <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coypu">nutria</a> families before having Greek food.</li>
