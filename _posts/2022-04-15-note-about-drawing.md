excerpt: "The most difficult part of the Drawabox program is the 50% rule."

Students are supposed to divide the time they spend drawing in two:

<ul class="smd-ul">
  <li>one half is dedicated to the exercises</li>
  <li>the other is reserved to drawing for the sake of drawing.</li>
</ul>

Like many others, I have issues with the latter. Sometimes it's difficult to come up with a subject, others to render it as I wished. It is, though, a crucial part of a process that takes time. Sometimes doodling helps me to avoid overthinking it. I drew this leaves-like composition on my tablet in my spare time recently and noticed how my mark is getting better lately.
