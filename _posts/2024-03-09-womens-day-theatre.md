It was a double celebration, actually, as it was my birthday a few days ago. Simone and I had delicious Thai food for lunch, before walking home. The cold and strong winds made it a more difficult, but nonetheless charming five kilometres stroll. Feeling tired and a bit sluggish, we considered swapping dates for the event we booked for the evening. I’m glad we didn’t.

We went to the Leper Chapel of St Mary Magdalene[^church], where Richard Spaul performed two Ghost Stories[^ghosts]. The first is _Miss Mary Pask_, by Edith Wharton[^wharton], the second is _Pink May_, by Elizabeth Bowen[^bowen]. His delivery, both spoken and sung, is moving. The venue is perfect, chilly and yet cozy. On the chairs arranged in front of Richard’s, an introductory text. One passage in particular got my attention:

> These are two prodigiously gifted women writers, far less celebrated than some of their male contemporaries in the same genre, but in my opinion far better, so I am hoping to make a tiny contribution to setting that record straight. They are not just writers who happen to be women. They deal in an extraordinarily powerful way, I think, with important women’s issues: social isolation, social conformity, sexual liberation and constraint, and the longing for happiness and fulfilment in an unequal and hampering world. That they achieve this through the unlikely medium of the ghost story is a great testament to their talent and originality.
> <cite>Richard Spaul</cite>

As we’re dealing with some of those issues even today, I can’t think of a better way to celebrate the women’s rights movement.
