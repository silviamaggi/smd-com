excerpt: "The other day, I listened to a very interesting episode of UX Podcast."

Hosts Per Axbom and James Royal-Lawson discuss a couple of articles, one about button design and the other about UX sitemamps. You read the latter correctly. I read the article a few months ago and felt buffled.

I found their conclusions insightful and balanced.
