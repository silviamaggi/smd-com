<p class="lead">New journey and new blog for my husband and I to record thoughts, experiences and memories. After nine years, we’re going back to our home country, Italy, where we’ll stay until the pandemic is under control.</p>

It feels like hitting the reset button: a much-needed pause to regroup and understand what to do next. We’ll be writing both in English and in Italian, on the blog [Oregano Dangereux](https://oreganodangereux.wordpress.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

<p class="detached">I’d be glad if you’d like to accompany us on this journey.</p>
