It feels like hitting the reset button: a much-needed pause to regroup and understand what to do next. We’ll be writing both in English and in Italian, on the blog [Oregano Dangereux](https://oreganodangereux.wordpress.com/).

<p class="detached">I’d be glad if you’d like to accompany us on this journey.</p>
