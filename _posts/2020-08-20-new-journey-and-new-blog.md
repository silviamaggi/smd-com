It feels like hitting the reset button: a much-needed pause to regroup and understand what to do next. We’ll be writing both in English and in Italian, on the blog _Oregano Dangereux_.

<p class="detached">I’d be glad if you’d like to accompany us on this journey.</p>

## Update

*15 February, 2024*

The mentioned blog has been deleted in the meantime. This is because we found little joy updating it, and because we’re both focused on our personal websites.
