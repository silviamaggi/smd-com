On week number 10 of my design inspiration series, I share resources about **inclusive design**, **problematic social media** facts, and a great music project.

### Inclusive Design

#### Articles

##### Why is designing for inclusion still treated as optional?

Karishma Patel takes us through her journey to integrate **accessibility** and **inclusive** design in **UX** work, and the barriers she encouters.

She shares valuable resources and, if you’re interested in more, check the links at the bottom of my article “[How Rebranding Cost Ravelry the Trust of Their Community](https://silviamaggidesign.com/2020/07/20/how-rebranding-cost-ravelry-the-trust-of-their-community/){:target="_blank"}“.

##### Legible font (still) one of the biggest accessibility issues in games

Game **accessibility** has come a long way recently, but **legible font** is still one of the biggest issues gamers encounter.

Karen Stevens, accessibility lead at EA Sports, shares her **recommendations**.

#### Video

The following video is a one-hour live episode of the podcast _[User Defenders](https://userdefenders.com/){:target="_blank"}_ recorded in December 2019 at _[An Event Apart Denver](https://aneventapart.com/){:target="_blank"}_.

Jason Ogle, together with Mina Markham, Farai Madzima and Derek Featherstone touch on important topics as **accessibility**, **design inclusion and ethics**, **hiring and retaining talent** and landing a job in **UX**.

Time well spent, if you ask me.
