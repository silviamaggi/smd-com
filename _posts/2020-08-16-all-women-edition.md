## You are not your data but your data is still you

We conceptualise our [personally identifiable information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data){:title="Read more on Wikipedia"} (PII) through privacy, which treats it as a property that is separate from us. Although, we don’t own the data the same way we own a house: _it is us_. In the article, Tricia Wand explains how the processes that involve algorithmic decision-making over human beings can become threats to our lives and communities.

## Benevolent sexism: a feminist comic explains how it holds women back

French artist Emma illustrates perfectly how certain friendly remarks can belittle women in the workplace. Reading through the comic, I found myself nodding along. As a woman in tech, I’ve experienced most of the situations described by Emma. Have you?

## Digital artwork by Es Devlin voices accounts of atomic bomb witnesses

Set designer Es Devlin and design associate Machiko Weston created _I Saw The World End_, a display to mark 75 years since the atomic bombs were dropped over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The work, commissioned by the Imperial War Museum, is a collective reading from both British and Japanese sources sharing thoughts and testimonies of the events.
