## Meet the computer scientist and activist who got Big Tech to stand down

Four years ago, as as a graduate at MIT’s Media Lab, Joy Buolamwini started looking at the racial, skin type and gender imbalances in facial recognition technologies. Her research helped persuade Amazon, IBM, and Microsoft to put a hold on facial recognition technology.

## You are not your data but your data is still you

We conceptualise our [personally identifiable information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data){:target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read more on Wikipedia"} (PII) through privacy, which treats it as a property that is separate from us. Although, we don’t own the data the same way we own a house: _it is us_. In the article, Tricia Wand explains how the processes that involve algorithmic decision-making over human beings can become threats to our lives and communities.

## WordPress All-women Release Squad

A release squad of people, who identify as women, will ship the next stable version of [WordPress CMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress){:target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read more on Wikipedia"} — the 5.5. It means giving equal opportunities, sharing experience and empowering. Kudos for this initiative.

## Benevolent sexism: a feminist comic explains how it holds women back

French artist Emma illustrates perfectly how certain friendly remarks can belittle women in the workplace. Reading through the comic, I found myself nodding along. As a woman in tech, I’ve experienced most of the situations described by Emma. Have you?

## Digital artwork by Es Devlin voices accounts of atomic bomb witnesses

Set designer Es Devlin and design associate Machiko Weston created _I Saw The World End_, a display to mark 75 years since the atomic bombs were dropped over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The work, commissioned by the Imperial War Museum, is a collective reading from both British and Japanese sources sharing thoughts and testimonies of the events.
