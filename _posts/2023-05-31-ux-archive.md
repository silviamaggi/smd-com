description: "I’ve created two GitHub repositories to gather good and bad user experiences from both digital and physical interactions."
excerpt: "A little side project that is going to help me, and hopefully others, to reference good and bad user experiences in our daily lives."

My work as a designer entails paying attention to my surroundings and take notes. The digital and physical interactions I encounter inform what I will design next.

Without an archive, I ended up with my phone and computer full of screenshots that don’t mean much in hindsight.

I’ve created a vault in Obsidian to gather good and bad user experiences. Then, [Simone](https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/) advised I publish them on GitHub.

That’s where you’ll find them. Work in progress.
