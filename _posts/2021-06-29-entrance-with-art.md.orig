Stepping into our new house for the summer, I wonder: how is it to live close to so much beauty? Art, architecture, poetry, food. This entrance is just the start.

This photo marks the first time I used my camera since 3 April, when the [wisteria started to bloom](https://silviamaggidesign.com/today-i-saw/wisteria-in-bloom/){:target="_blank"} in the seaside town.
