I tend to think about the past four years as a negative period of my life. In a way, it’s true. I was back in Italy, but not feeling home, and I had stopped doing what I like most: taking pictures, baking bread, knitting. I used to say that I was dead inside, and couldn’t be creative.

A few days ago, flicking through my notes, I found the sketches I made while following the [Drawabox]({{ site.url }}/tag/drawabox) lessons. They’re crude, somehow imbarassing, but I think it’s important to publish them as a reminder of everything that went well.

The following are various drawings of objects I either had in front of me, or I was recalling to memory.
