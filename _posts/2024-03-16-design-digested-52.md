## Digital design is conflicted
> UX is conflicted. Iâ€™m conflicted. I'm conflicted between pushing to go fast and fighting to slow down. Iâ€™m caught between fixing things and breaking things. Iâ€™m forced to compromise between caring and causing harm.

James Royal-Lawson wrote an essay I wholly support. In it, he describes the many conflicts designers are presented with, why, and what to do to resolve them. I bookmarked it because it contains data and advice useful to make the case against the infamous _move fast and break things_ motto.

## Itâ€™s 2023, here is why your web design sucks
> [&hellip;] the gendering of design as womenâ€™s work is why people donâ€™t use the title "web designer" anymore. Itâ€™s been belittled and othered away. Itâ€™s why we've split that web design role into two; now you're either a UX designer and you can sit at that table over there or youâ€™re a front-end developer and you can sit at the table with the people that build websites.

This one hit home. At some point, the title of web designer disappeared. I had no clue of the reason behind the split, and just went with it, choosing UX design over web development. Rachel Buchel is spot on, and reading it all so well layed out left me gobsmacked, irritated, and nostalgic.

## Please, donâ€™t force me to log in
> It feels like everything these days needs you to create an account and log in to use them.

Good point from Juhis. Opening an account is a hassle that should be balanced in favour of users. Good reason: to keep track of progress on a learning service. Bad reason: to gather more data. Accounts can also be barriers to information â€“ see the small businesses that created a Facebook page instead of a website.
