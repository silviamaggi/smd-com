## The last design you'll ever make

To conserve the resources we have, repairing products to extend their lifespan is critical as there are currently no viable alternatives. How can we design the last product our customers will ever need buy?

## Designing for the autistic community

Cognitive overload, the term created in the context of education to describe that every brain has a limited capacity, is something most of us experience in our daily life. But there is one group that experiences this on a much larger scale — autistic people.

> In this guide, I will outline the core principles of designing for autistic people and reducing the cognitive load for everyone who uses digital products.
> <cite>Irina Rusakova</cite>

## Cautionary tales from cryptoland

While Web3 advocates focus on what the future of the internet could be, skeptics such as Molly White, a software developer and Wikipedia editor, are focused on the very real problems of the here and now.

> HBR.org spoke to White over email about what people aren’t hearing about Web3, how blockchain could make internet harassment much worse, and why the whole project might be “an enormous grift that’s pouring lighter fluid on our already-smoldering planet.”

## The “tender technicians” of Nielsen Norman Group videos

Nielsen Norman Group (NN/g) YouTube content predominantly features young, white or white-presenting, normatively attractive women. The uniform presentation of these women, combined with the unspecific, universalizing script content, compromises their expertise and is objectifying. This treatment, combined with a lack of diversity in featured employees, undercuts NN/g’s standing as an authoritative resource in the field of user experience (UX).

## Covid-19: a tech post-mortem

Two years ago, in the first half of 2020, private companies and governments alike were rolling the dice and betting on tech-solutionism to fight the global spread of SARS‑CoV‑2, better known as COVID19. One of the pillars in the global response has been the roll-out of Apps, which Privacy International have been keeping an eye on since the beginning.

## Occlusion Grotesque 2022

Occlusion Grotesque is an experimental typeface that is carved into the bark of a tree. As the tree grows, it deforms the letters and outputs new design variations, that are captured annually. The project explores what it means to design with nature and on nature's terms.

## Michał Dyjuk – Cows can smell the scent of death

In his series of haunting images, Michał Dyjuk rethinks photography in an attempt to preserve the memory of a lesser-known tragedy of the 20th century that unfolded in the forests of Augustow, his home in Poland.

> The landscape too seems to forget human suffering. Struggle as we might against forgetting, generations change, and tragedies are absorbed into everyday existence. Who remembers the turbulence of war of centuries long past? Do death and pain leave no trace?
