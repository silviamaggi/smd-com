<p class="lead">Pesky migraines, caviar, and photos.</p>

<!--more-->

<ul class="smd-ul">
  <li>The strongest memory I have of last week is that of a pesky migraine.</li>
  <li>On Friday night, we went to Ikea to buy a few pieces of furniture to organise our room. Being surrounded by Swedish things reminded me that our last holiday was in February 2020, when we visited Jönköping and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/silvia-m/albums/72157623257284595" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stockholm</a>. I felt overwhelmed with memories, sensations, and everything that comes with the prospect of moving to a new country.</li>
  <li>I found comfort in food. Specifically, in a tube of <a href="https://www.scandikitchen.co.uk/product/abba-kalles-kaviar-original-190g-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Kalles Kaviar</em></a>. I spread it on multigrain crispbread on Saturday morning, after a classically sweet Italian breakfast.</li>
  <li>Organising the room meant we're now able to watch our favourite series again. We finished <em>Sex Education</em>, which we enjoyed a lot.</li>
  <li>On Sunday, we visited <em>Crespi d'Adda</em> - <a href="https://visitcrespi.it/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unesco site since 1995</a> - with friends. The day started quite gloomy, and became sunny in the afternoon. We had lunch by the river Adda: I ate a <em>fritto misto</em>.</li>
  <li>The Ikea products names triggered my curiousity again, so I resumed my studies of the Swedish language. While I'am a it, I'm reviewing my French as well. The starting language is English for both, which probably makes it weird. I see it as a way to learn or maintain three languages at once.</li>
  <li>The radiator in our room is still <a href="https://silviamaggidesign.com/weeknotes/weeknotes-3/">turned off</a>.</li>
