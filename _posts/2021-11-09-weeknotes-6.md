excerpt: 'Overwhelming and underwhelming experiences. Decisions and promises.'

<ul class="smd-ul">
  <li>Up until last week, there seemed to be an <a href="https://silviamaggidesign.com/weeknotes/weeknotes-2/">invisible barrier</a> at the <em>bastioni in Porta Venezia</em> that stopped Simone and I from going to the city centre. Well, no more. We ventured toward <em>Piazza San Babila</em> and then <em>Piazza Duomo</em>, only to came home utterly overwhelmed. The crowd, the noise, and the breathlessness from the <abbr title="Filtering Facepiece 2">FFP2</abbr> masks were too much.</li>
  <li><em>Boots</em> recently opened in Milan. I bought medicines and beauty products there for years in the UK, so visiting such a smaller branch was underwhelming. They only sell the most expensive line of <em>N&deg;7</em> products, and prices are higher as a whole â€” probably because of the currency exchange and import fees. Nonetheless, I found one of my favourite moisturizing creams, which has a crucial <code>30SFP</code>.</li>
  <li>I also went to <em>Zara</em> to try their rechargable and cheap makeup products. So far so good. I don't agree with their clothing business model, but I like their effort to make products that can be recycled and replaced.</li>
  <li>To overwrite the experience in the city centre, we walked in the big park. I recharged and made mental pictures, with the promise of coming back next time with the camera.</li>
  <li>I am <a href="https://silviamaggidesign.com/newsletter/archive/newsletter-32/" title="Read more about the decision in my latest newsletter">moving away from Mailchimp</a>.
