<p class="lead">On the latest letter I sent out on 20 June, I set out my plans for the next few months. Ever felt overwhelmed by the quantity of information found on the internet? Then you’ll know what I’m talking about.</p>

As the temperatures in this part of Italy hit 32˚C, I’m reminded how the human body takes time to adapt, and that I’m definitively still a stranger in my own country. Here’s the thing: I don’t want to get used to this. Let me switch the air conditioner on, so I can tell you with more clarity what’s to come.

_Design, Digested_ is a design newsletter. Yet, I’ve been talking about different things recently, and practically stopped writing about design on my blog. On the one hand, I took a break from the information overload I’ve been experiencing; on the other, **I focused my attention on more authoritative UX sources** that I’m currently processing.

If you ever got lost in Medium articles and blog posts and felt like you were missing crucial skills, you know what I mean by information overload. In this situation it’s easy to get caught in opinions and trends, wasting time and energy in something that won’t last or doesn’t have solid foundations. I don’t want to get used to this either.

During the coming weeks, I’ll be sharing these UX sources here and on the blog. There will be the other things too — books, TV series, films, games and photography. The frequency of the emails might change as, hopefully, we all spend more time outside this summer.

<p class="detached">Take care,<br>
Silvia</p>
