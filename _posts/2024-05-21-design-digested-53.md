## The smartphone kids are not all right

> So itâ€™s not until 2010â€“2011 that you have this thing in your pocket, which is not a digital Swiss Army knife that _you_ pull out when you need something. It is now a portal that millionsâ€”millionsâ€”of companies now can use to get to you, as a child. Without your parentsâ€™ permission or knowledge, they can get to you. They can send you notifications. They can try to get you to stop your homework and: _Comeâ€”look at what someone just said about you_.

Senior editor Hanna Rosin interviews social psychologist and author Jonathan Haidt about his recent book _The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood Is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness_. She spoke to her son Jacob, too, to juxtapose theory with lived experience.

## Smartphone pervasiveness

> I stop at a red light on the way to the supermarket and notice other drivers next to me automatically reaching for their phones because they have two seconds to spare that apparently absolutely need to be spend on more distraction/addiction feeding.

I already knew everything Wouter describes â€“ itâ€™s difficult to spot people without phones in their hand these days. Still, reading it all in a well laid post gave me the creeps.

## Heat death of the internet
> You want to watch a TV show from your youth so you check a streaming service, but it is not there, so you check a second streaming service but it is not there, so you check a third streaming service and it is not there. You search for it on Blu-ray but it doesnâ€™t exist, so you search for it on DVD but it is out of print.

This story is tagged _fiction_, but Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll find at least one modern life fact you can relate to.
