## Thereâ€™s a pandemic of online violence against women and girls

> There is a pandemic of online gender-based violence emerging during Covid-19, and it must be addressed now. The increased domestic violence against women witnessed during the crisis is spilling into the online space, turning the lifeline of the internet into a hostile space.

## Telegram still hasnâ€™t removed an AI bot thatâ€™s abusing women

A deepfake bot has generated tens of thousands of non-consensual images of women and underage girls on the messaging platform, which is now under pressure to crack down on it. Researchers also found groups devoted to revenge porn and the sharing of non-consensual photos that donâ€™t involve bots.

## Oxford Dictionaries amends â€˜sexistâ€™ definitions of the word â€˜womanâ€™

Following the successful petition of [Maria Beatrice Giovanardi](https://twitter.com/mbgiovanardi?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, Oxford Dictionaries amended the sexist definitions of the word _woman_. Other definitions remain â€” albeit labelled as offensive â€” failing to satisfy equality campaigners. Maria Beatrice received compliments, offences, and threats of rape.

## Italian state TVâ€™s â€˜sexy shoppingâ€™ tutorial for women sparks outrage

On the eve of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, _Detto Fatto_ â€” a daily early morning programme on the Italian state TV â€” showed tips on how to shop for groceries in a sexy way for women. The outrage that followed sparked the broadcaster _Rai 2_ to suspend the programme, only to play a previous episode containing a lingerie catwalk complete with advice on push-up bras.

## What happens when our bodies are digital?

Iâ€™ve enjoyed this talk between digital sociologist [Silvia Semenzin](https://www.instagram.com/silviasemenzin_/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, influencer [Camihawke](https://www.instagram.com/camihawke/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, and presenter [Sofia Viscardi](https://www.instagram.com/sofiaviscardi/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} about what happens when our faces and bodies are online. They touch on privacy, misogyny, sex education and more.
