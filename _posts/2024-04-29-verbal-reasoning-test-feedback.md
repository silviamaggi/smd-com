Hi <code>[recruiter’s name]</code>,

As I failed the Product Design / Verbal Reasoning test, I don’t expect the recruiting process to continue.

I would like to offer you my feedback and opinion on the experience, as <code>[company name]</code> might find it useful in the future.

It was the first time I had been asked to perform such a test. My experience was negative, although I still believe I could have been a good fit for the role.

My 20+ working experience is usually enough to start a conversation and give an idea of how I approach problems. Throughout my career, whenever I didn’t know enough about something <code>[the section with the most errors]</code>, I studied, asked my colleagues and learned.

I firmly believe that these tests exclude perfectly good professionals, whose talent cannot be reliably measured through such tests. These people might:

- be neurodiverse
- have some form of dyslexia (even if they don’t know it yet)
- have been born and raised in another country and culture, therefore have English as a second/third language
- not perform well under pressure (see the unnecessarily timed questions)

Yet they’re likely to have had successful careers during which they solved design problems creatively and in harmony with their teams.

I know how difficult it is to hire people today, and it is also very difficult to get hired. I understand that initial screenings can be important. I’m also sure that my feedback is useful, because the candidate’s experience is a crucial part of every company’s culture.

Best Wishes
