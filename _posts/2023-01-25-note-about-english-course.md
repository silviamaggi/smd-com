Just like Simone, I wanted to refresh my knowledge of the English language before going back to the UK. When starting a new course, Duolingo asks whether the person is new to language or not. If not, it tests the level to establish the starting point.

I've encountered the problematic phrases Simone pointed out, and many more. It makes me question if the same happens in other languages I'm studying from English.
