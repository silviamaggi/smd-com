I finished reading _Normal People_ for the second time. In between, I saw the TV series. It seems I couldn't let go of Marianne and Connell, some aspects of their story so similar to mine. It's not the first time I feel so emotionally involved in a fictional story, and hopefully it won't be the last. I don't buy into the argument that _Normal People_ is a millennial story. I honestly don't even know what that means. With a few small changes on what tech the characters use to communicate, the dates, and locations, the story is universal. Now I'm reading _Conversations with Friends_, as Sally Rooney's writing and themes feel familiar to me.

About 12 months ago, we had just finished organising the house after the move, and I was waiting for my ukulele to be delivered. In this relatively short amount of time a lot had happened, seemingly at the same time. I call it my perfect storm.

Fluctuations in my oestrogen levels have become annoying and noticeable enough for the GP to declare I entered perimenopause. As my body sends me signals I don't recognise, my mind does the same. With the loss of an important person thrown in, and the difficulties of finding a job, I couldn't keep everything together anymore. I had lost control. With that came depression which, together with anxiety, is a long time companion. As the situation didn't seem to improve by itself, I followed my husband's advice and asked for help.

A few sessions of EMDR[^emdr] and an SSRI[^ssri] prescription later, I started feeling much better. Now I am having regular sessions with a psychologist, who is helping me to heal. During the initial sessions it transpired that I present traits of neuro divergency. Specifically, of ADHD (the inattentive type), and autism. I had suspects about my brain not being "typical", but years ago I took a test that didn't put me in the spectrum, so I brushed my doubts and went on with my life.

Luckily now there is more awareness of girls and women presenting traits differently from boys and men, so even though not officially diagnosed yet, I'm analysing my life through neurodivergent lens. As people like me previously said, and will keep saying, now everything makes sense. Explaining events, behaviours, feelings with a neurodivergent brain can be quite liberating and enlightening. However, with the positive feelings comes grief. The bullying, the difficulties at school, the low self-esteem, the longing to fit in systematically unmet. If I knew sooner, would have my life been different? It became clear to me that I wore many masks to make myself socially acceptable, which begs the question: who am I?

For now, I have started with who I am not. I'm not a person that has a newsletter. [I sent out the last one]({{ site.url }}/newsletter/archive/newsletter-69/) at the beginning of November this year, saying that I was stepping away from the UX industry. After months of discomfort and hopelessness, I know which path I want to try, but that's another story for another place. I have plans to change my website from a container of everything, to a personal one. This means moving work related posts elsewhere.

I am not sure what comes next, but it will come from the authentic place where I will have learned to respect my needs.

It's been quite a year.
