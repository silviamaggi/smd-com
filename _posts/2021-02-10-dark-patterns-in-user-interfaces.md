<p class="lead">Recently, I read a couple of compelling blog post about dark patterns in user interfaces copy that I want to share with you. They’re an essential read to understand what they are, how they’re used to deceive people and how to recognise them.</p>

<!--more-->

The many examples of UI dark patterns in the articles show how shady the internet has become, with the line between encouraging people to use a product and tricking them into handing over personal data or money being thinner than ever.

The articles are an essential read if you are:

<ul class="smd-ul">
<li><strong>A designer</strong>, so that you’re aware of the many practises and how you can push back if your company uses them.</li>
<li><strong>A person</strong> who navigates the internet and uses services.</li>
<li><strong>Interested</strong> in exploring ethical and privacy-focused alternatives to the most used services.</li>
</ul>
