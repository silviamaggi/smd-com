The many examples of UI dark patterns in the articles show how shady the internet has become, with the line between encouraging people to use a product and tricking them into handing over personal data or money being thinner than ever. The articles are an essential read if you are:

<ul class="smd-ul">
<li><strong>A designer</strong>, so that you’re aware of the many practises and how you can push back if your company uses them.</li>
<li><strong>A person</strong> who navigates the internet and uses services.</li>
<li><strong>Interested</strong> in exploring ethical and privacy-focused alternatives to the most used services.</li>
</ul>
