The many examples of UI dark patterns in the articles show how shady the internet has become, with the line between encouraging people to use a product and tricking them into handing over personal data or money being thinner than ever. The articles are an essential read if you are:

<li><strong>A person</strong> who navigates the internet and uses services.</li>
