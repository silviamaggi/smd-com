Recently, I read a couple of compelling blog post about dark patterns in user interfaces copy that I want to share with you. They’re an essential read to understand what they are, how they’re used to deceive people and how to recognise them.

The many examples of UI dark patterns in the articles show how shady the internet has become, with the line between encouraging people to use a product and tricking them into handing over personal data or money being thinner than ever.

The articles are an essential read if you are:

* **A designer**, so that you’re aware of the many practises and how you can push back if your company uses them.
* **A person** who navigates the internet and uses services.
* **Interested** in exploring ethical and privacy-focused alternatives to the most used services.
