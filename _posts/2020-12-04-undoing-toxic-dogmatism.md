## Undoing the toxic dogmatism of digital design

_How do we start to dismantle and rebuild a system that disempowers and excludes “by design”?_, asks Lisa Angela. The design industry’s accepted and most practised ways of creating digital products are flawed, as is the way we educate aspiring designers.  
If you read only one design article this week, this should be it.

## Designing the smallest possible thing

_If designers want to work agilely and still design great, user-centred products, we need to stop designing faster and learn how to start designing less_, explains Laura Klein in an article I wish I read years ago. Designing small has a lot of advantages and doesn’t mean sacrificing quality.

## Elliott Erwitt: ‘Photography is pretty simple. You just react to what you see’

During his 70-year long career, Elliot Erwitt witnessed some of the most notable moments of modern history. A man of few words, he lets his photography speak for himself, and reminds us that the best things happen when we take our camera with us.

        <span>I read the Lisa Angela and although I'm not a designer, I agree with what she says. There's not enough daring experimentation or evolution in design because the ideas pot is too stagnant. I'm hoping to see some really groundbreaking systems in the next 5 years as the field widens.</span>

        <span>Hi Mel, I hope that too. In general, we're seeing a lot of design problems solved the same way, and features copied between an app to the other. Most of the times, the pace of business is too fast for people to come with new and yet to be tested ideas, but it's going to be crucial.</span>
