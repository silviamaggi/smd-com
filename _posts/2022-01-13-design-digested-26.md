## Why UX researchers should stop solving problems

> Often UX designers are focused on the solution, he said, rather than a deeper consideration of the people they’re trying to help. That’s partly because designers only control part of the experience, said Portigal, who appeared via videoconferencing from California where he’s based.

## “The Lean Startup” is outdated. Drop everything that comes from it

> “The Lean Startup” was published in 2011, and introduced or popularized a lot of what is used in tech today, even in non-Lean and non-startup environments. And it’s time we stopped reading it.<cite>Debbie Levitt</cite>

## “Cognitive milestoning” and the myth of minimizing clicks for optimal UX design

For years, the [three-click](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-click_rule) rule drove the choices of web designers, but it's time to aknowledge that it is disproven. Darren Hood explains why his theory is a viable UX strategy to use in all design projects.

## Digital is the problem

> In the beginning, we digitized. We turned analog artifacts into digital artifacts. Letters for example, or ledgers. And music, of course. Then, our current reading goes, we started “digit-al-izing”, a different thing altogether: we applied digitization to the larger processes. In the 1980s, digitalization was already underway in a number of industries but, as usual, the future was not evenly distributed. <cite>Andrea Resmini</cite>

## From Mad magazine to B-movies: an oral history of Beastie Boys’ artwork

> During the ’80s and ’90s, Beastie Boys were unrivalled when it came to their visual identity, which was cool, surreal, artistic, and hilarious all at the same time. The rap trio made brilliant albums backed up with beautiful artwork, and staggeringly original videos that created new genres of their own. It wasn’t the work of one man exactly, but Adam Yauch, aka MCA, certainly drove that artistic vision.
