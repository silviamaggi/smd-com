Between the ups and downs of the global **pandemic** and **lockdown**, I kept taking pictures. I intended to have a **photo diary** to describe my take on **isolation** and the extraordinary circumstances we’re living.

Time seemed to have lost its **meaning**; some days were **painfully long**, while it felt like Spring ended **too quickly**.

As family and friends were **safe**, it became clear that mulling over the **news** and social media was not an option.

Instead, it’s been a period of **introspection**, **studies** and **observations**, alternated with moments of **anxiety** because of the lack of clarity on the future.

I’m still mostly isolating and avoiding all unnecessary activities. Nevertheless, it feels like this isolation photo diary should be **over**, and give way to a **different** period, one with **hope** and **plans** in sight.
