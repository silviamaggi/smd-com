<p class="lead">The one where I started doing things that feel more habitual.</p>

<ul class="smd-ul">
  <li>I completed <a href="https://silviamaggidesign.com/about-silviamaggi-ux-designer/">two courses</a> with IDF (Interaction Design Foundation): <em>Human-Computer Interaction - HCI</em>, and <em>Design for the 21st Century with Don Norman</em>. I intend to finish three more before my membership expires in a few months.</li>
  <li>Autumn is somewhat evident here, and it only gets colder in the morning and night (it's 18&deg; on Monday afternoon, while I'm writing this). In the building, the central heating system has been switched on last week. We turned down the radiator in our room.</li>
  <li>My hair grew 3cm in three months, so it was time for a new cut. I miss my trusted hairdresser in Cambridge, but the new one in Milan is just as good.</li>
  <li>We took a train for the first time since September 2020. The last time I departed from <em>Milano Centrale</em> station was in January 2020.</li>
  <li>I'm not able to cope with a bad night's sleep anymore. It's not just about the crankiness: mind and body don't work properly.</li>
  <li>Being able to visit my family frequently is both nice and strange. My parents celebrated their 44th anniversary, and we ate too much.</li>
