description: "Today I tell you why I deleted my Twitter account and give you an update on why I've been silent on my blog lately."
excerpt: 'Today I deleted my Twitter account, and it felt good. I had been visiting to keep up to date with other UX professional, but it was impossible to avoid retweets about politics and other topics.'

The only way to hide certain subjects is to spend time blocking keywords and excluding the retweets of the accounts you follow. An action to perform for each account. **It’s time I’d rather not waste**. I set to follow those professionals’ blog posts and newsletters where possible, to keep updated without distractions from rants, viral tweets and trending hashtags.

In other news, I’ve been silent on my blog because my husband and I moved out of the UK almost two weeks ago. It’s been and intense month, but we can now rest and resume our activities.
