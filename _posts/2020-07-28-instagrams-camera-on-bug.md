<p class="lead">Instagram is reportedly fixing the camera-on bug, which was discovered by a user while testing Apple‚Äôs iOS 14 beta version.</p>

<!--more-->

The upcoming iOS 14 alerts users every time apps access phone features like clipboard and camera. A person who is testing the beta version found out that Instagram switches the camera ‚Äî and arguably the microphone ‚Äî on when browsing the feed.

An Instagram spokesperson said the behaviour is a bug, which is being fixed. Last year, [Facebook fixed a similar issue](https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/12/20961332/facebooks-ios-app-reportedly-camera-background-security){:target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read the article 'Facebook‚Äôs iOS app might be opening the camera in the background without your knowledge' on The Verge"}. Apple‚Äôs new privacy notifications are going to be incredibly useful to understand whether and how apps are violating our privacy. I hope this will be the start of better practices and transparency.

Many don‚Äôt trust Facebook and its practices. Do you trust Instagram more, even if it‚Äôs clearer they‚Äôre part of the [same company](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/04/tech/facebook-new-logo/index.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read the article 'Facebook unveils new logo to help differentiate it from its other brands' on the CNN"}? I don‚Äôt. These bugs are worrying and I believe we should always be in control of our devices and data.

        <span>Yes, it sounds dodgy, and it‚Äôs hardly a poster for privacy and security, whether they‚Äôre doing it on purpose or not.</span>
