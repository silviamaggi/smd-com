### German Politicians Don’t Talk About The Virus Like Other Nations. Here’s What It Means

**Language matters**. A lot. Humans thrive on **stories**: it’s the way our brains encode **memories** while we make sense of them and find meaning. The words we use to tell stories set the **tone** and our perception. This is crucial for **storytelling** in design and life alike.

### Glossier’s Mobile Navigation

This week’s first article is about **challenging assumptions**. [Glossier](https://www.glossier.com/){:target="_blank"}’s user experience department studied how people **navigate** their site and found that the very commonly used **hamburger** menu on mobile didn’t work for them. It’s an old article, and in the meantime they redesigned the navigation, but it’s still a good read.

### Don’t Make Me Think – Key Learning Points For UX Design For The Web

Released in the year 2000, _Don’t Make Me Think_ is still one of the **defining texts** for anyone who works in the **web** industry. It’s the short, and to-the-point book that set my career firmly towards **usability** and **UX**. The article explains its key points.

### Responsive Web Design Turns Ten

Time flies. Ever since the original _Responsive Web Design_ article ten years ago, the way we design and develop websites **changed radically**. Before, we used to create **dedicated** mobile websites to be maintained **separately**. After, we started creating **device-agnostic** websites. Happy birthday, RWD.

### Mobile First by Luke Wroblewski

This week’s digest concludes with another **defining text**. In 2011, while _Responsive Web Design_ was relatively new, it was common to design a website for **larger screens** before thinking about how it worked on mobile. However, designing for **mobile-first** has many advantages. The **constraints** of mobile help building better experiences.
