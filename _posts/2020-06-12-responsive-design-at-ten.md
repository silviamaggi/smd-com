## German Politicians Donâ€™t Talk About The Virus Like Other Nations. Hereâ€™s What It Means

Language matters. A lot. Humans thrive on stories: itâ€™s the way our brains encode memories while we make sense of them and find meaning. The words we use to tell stories set the tone and our perception. This is crucial for storytelling in design and life alike.

## Glossierâ€™s Mobile Navigation

This article is about challenging assumptions. Glossierâ€™s user experience department studied how people navigate their site and found that the very commonly used hamburger menu on mobile didnâ€™t work for them. Itâ€™s an old article, and in the meantime they redesigned the navigation, but itâ€™s still a good read.

## Donâ€™t Make Me Think â€“ Key Learning Points For UX Design For The Web

Released in the year 2000, _Donâ€™t Make Me Think_ is still one of the defining texts for anyone who works in the web industry. Itâ€™s the short, and to-the-point book that set my career firmly towards usability and UX. The article explains its key points.

## Responsive Web Design Turns Ten

Time flies. Ever since the original _Responsive Web Design_ article ten years ago, the way we design and develop websites changed radically. Before, we used to create dedicated mobile websites to be maintained separately. After, we started creating device-agnostic websites. Happy birthday, RWD.

## Designing For The Constraints Caused By Social Distance

If social distancing is the new norm for the foreseeable future, we need to understand how to design with this constraint in mind and with regard to what we know about collaboration, privacy, space and expectations.

## Mobile First by Luke Wroblewski

This weekâ€™s digest concludes with another defining text. In 2011, while _Responsive Web Design_ was relatively new, it was common to design a website for larger screens before thinking about how it worked on mobile. However, designing for mobile-first has many advantages. The constraints of mobile help building better experiences.
