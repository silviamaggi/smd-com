<p class="lead">I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve encountered many posts about which tool is best for wireframing. Yet, one of UX designers‚Äô most important and basic tool is <strong>sketching</strong>. If you know how to convey your ideas and concepts through sketches, the rest follows.</p>

Unless you were hired to create a UX team from scratch, chances are you‚Äôll have to **adapt to use** whatever software your company is using: Axure, Adobe, Figma, Sketch and so on. The one skill you‚Äôll have to develop is the willingness to **put as many ideas as possible on paper**, and leave behind the ones that don‚Äôt work.

Up until recently, drawing ‚Äî or even writing something on a whiteboard ‚Äî terrified me. I‚Äôm very self-conscious about my bad writing, and being left-handed often led me to present smudges to people.

An article from the Interaction Design Foundation convinced me to get over my fears and start sketching, even in my day-to-day life. Jose Rojas, the article‚Äôs author, highlights the advantages and **methods of sketching**. However, what struck me most was the following advice:

> As a designer, you will find it‚Äôs a great idea to make a habit of always carrying a notebook to keep a record of objects, designs and actions that provoke or inspire you.
>
> <cite>‚Äî Jose Rojas</cite>

It can be a notebook, your phone‚Äôs camera, or both. **Observing and recording our surroundings** helps us develop a critical eye.

## Start sketching

You don‚Äôt need to be an artist to sketch effectively but there are a few techniques you should learn. If you, like me, need to have visual cues and some explaination, Matt Corrall‚Äôs video helps greatly.

I used Matt‚Äôs advice to refine storyboard and wireframes for the [Acclimatize.me case study]({{ site.url }}/portfolio/case-study-acclimatize-me/), and I‚Äôm happy with the result.

## Go beyond

Whether you‚Äôre a UX designer or not, learning how to sketch can benefit you in many ways.

> I believe drawing is a skill, which means that it‚Äôs something obtainable. Anyone can pick it up, learn, improve and eventually become great at it.

> <cite>‚Äî Jos√© Torre</cite>

**The secret is repetition**, says Jos√© Torre. You just need to get started. In the article he explains why, when, what and how to start drawing today. Jos√© also suggests you can use drawings to **illustrate your ideas in presentations** as well.

He reminded me of the insightful and delightful webinar by UX designer [Morgane Peng](https://www.morganepeng.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, [_How to Deal with People Who Don‚Äôt ‚ÄúGet‚Äù Design_](https://youtu.be/jXkMWvXx3MI){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. Her illustrations complement perfectly her message while making the talk enjoyable and fun.

<hr>

If you wish to take it to next level, Dr. Betty Edwards‚Äô _New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain_ workbook offers **effective exercises** that reinforce the five basic skills of drawing:

<ul class="smd-ul">
<li>The perception of edges.</li>
<li>The perception of spaces.</li>
<li>The perception of relationships.</li>
<li>The perception of lights and shadows.</li>
<li>The perception of the Gestalt.</li>
</ul>

The workbook is the ideal companion of the book, where the theory behind the techniques is explained. Although, I went directly for the exercises.

## Update

As much as wanted to follow my own advice and sketch every day, I couldn‚Äôt follow my own advice: I‚Äôd stare at the blank page, not knowing _what_ to draw, and then give up.

After reading an article, I started a new journey and wrote about it on the post [Learning to draw: a journey]({{ site.url }}/drawing/learning-to-draw/).
