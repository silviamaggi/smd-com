I’m sure you’ve encountered many posts about which tool is best for wireframing. Yet, one of UX designers’ most important and basic tool is **sketching**.

<!--more-->

If you know how to convey your ideas and concepts through sketches, the rest follows.

Unless you were hired to create a UX team from scratch, chances are you’ll have to **adapt to use** whatever software your company is using: Axure, Adobe, Figma, Sketch and so on. The one skill you’ll have to develop is the willingness to **put as many ideas as possible on paper**, and leave behind the ones that don’t work.

Up until recently, drawing — or even writing something on a whiteboard — terrified me. I’m very self-conscious about my bad writing, and being left-handed often led me to present smudges to people.

An article from the Interaction Design Foundation convinced me to get over my fears and start sketching, even in my day-to-day life.

Jose Rojas, the article’s author, highlights the advantages and **methods of sketching**. However, what struck me most was the following advice:

> As a designer, you will find it’s a great idea to make a habit of always carrying a notebook to keep a record of objects, designs and actions that provoke or inspire you.
>
> <cite>Jose Rojas</cite>

It can be a notebook, your phone’s camera, or both. **Observing and recording our surroundings** helps us develop a critical eye.

## Start sketching

You don’t need to be an artist to sketch effectively but there are a few techniques you should learn. If you, like me, need to have visual cues and some explaination, Matt Corrall’s video helps greatly.

I used Matt’s advice to refine storyboard and wireframes for the [Acclimatize.me case study](https://silviamaggidesign.com/portfolio/case-study-acclimatize-me/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, and I’m happy with the result.

## Go beyond

Whether you’re a UX designer or not, learning how to sketch can benefit you in many ways.

> […] I believe drawing is a skill, which means that it’s something obtainable. Anyone can pick it up, learn, improve and eventually become great at it.

**The secret is repetition**, says José Torre. You just need to get started. In the article he explains why, when, what and how to start drawing today.

José also suggests you can **use drawings to illustrate your ideas in presentations** as well.

He reminded me of the insightful and delightful webinar by UX designer [Morgane Peng](https://www.morganepeng.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, [_How to Deal with People Who Don’t “Get” Design_](https://youtu.be/jXkMWvXx3MI){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. Her illustrations complement perfectly her message while making the talk enjoyable and fun.

If you wish to take it to next level, Dr. Betty Edwards’ _New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain_ workbook offers **effective exercises** that reinforce the five basic skills of drawing:

* The perception of edges.
* The perception of spaces.
* The perception of relationships.
* The perception of lights and shadows.
* The perception of the Gestalt.

The workbook is the ideal companion of the book, where the theory behind the techniques is explained. Although, I went directly for the exercises.

## Update

As much as wanted to follow my own advice and sketch every day, I couldn’t follow my own advice: I’d stare at the blank page, not knowing _what_ to draw, and then give up.

After reading an article, I started a new journey and wrote about it on the post [Learning to draw: a journey](https://silviamaggidesign.com/design/learning-to-draw/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
