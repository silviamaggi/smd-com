<p class="lead">The last time I was out and about with the intention of taking pictures, was in November 2016, in <a href="{{ site.url }}/photography/the-berlin-fascination/">Berlin</a>.</p>

After that, it took me some time to organise and process the work I came back with. During the Christmas holidays, I read a few articles about post-processing in Lightroom and learned a few tricks I wanted to apply to older photos. Time flew.

Going through last year's photos, I found quite a few of them have trees as a subject. Trees are fascinating and elegant, no matter the season. They can set the mood of a photo.

Some are more striking than others, like the ones at [Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp](http://www.stiftung-bg.de/gums/en/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. They're beautiful figures in a former place of terror and death, and probably their falling leaves and autumnal aspect contributed to the disturbing atmosphere.
