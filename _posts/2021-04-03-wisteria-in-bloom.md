Before the weather turned chilly again, we’ve enjoyed very mild temperatures. It’s easy to think the winter has gone, when the temperature is 22ºC and the flowers are blooming.

Only a few days ago, the wisteria in the yard was pretty much asleep. Now, it’s giving us a hint of its beauty.

I know the plant as _glicine_ (ˈɡlitʃine). Its Italian name derives from the Greek _glykýs_, which means ‘sweet’.

Wisteria evokes the warm, sunny afternoons spent underneath a pergola [by the lake](https://silviamaggidesign.com/photography/instagram-drained-my-creativity/){:target="_blank"} in my hometown. I can’t wait to see this one at its peak.
