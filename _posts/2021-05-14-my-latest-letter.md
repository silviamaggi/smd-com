Every couple of weeks, I write a letter to the nice people subscribed to [_Design, Digested_](https://silviamaggidesign.com/design-inspiration-newsletter-silvia-maggi/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. Today, I want to share the latest with you. As there weren’t any new blog posts or projects to announce, I didn’t know what to write. Yet, I ended up writing a lot.

I was initially embarrassed while thinking about what to tell you. Yet, what I read, watch and interests me everyday helps me grow. Or simply amuses me.

## What I’m reading

### Just Enough Research by Erika Hall (second edition)

**A cornerstone for anyone who wants to design the right thing for their clients.** Useful and witty.

* [**Read about the book on A Book Apart**](https://abookapart.com/products/just-enough-research){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

### Dove mi trovo by Jhumpa Lahiri

My favourite author, who now writes in Italian too. **This is her first Italian novel, out in English as _Whereabouts_**. I’m devouring this short book where her classic themes of attachment and estrangement, nostalgia and solitude are at their peak.

* **[Read by the book on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41584982-dove-mi-trovo?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=lcMmyMCBkh&rank=1){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}**

## What I’m watching

### Silicon Valley

A TV series friends recommended years ago, that I watched only recently. **Six brief series where a group of developers tries to build their start-up.** Loads of laughing-out-loud moments, and a few annoying ones. Blink and it’s the series finale, with nostalgia and a hint of sadness.

* **[Check Silicon Valley on IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2575988/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}**

### For All Mankind

**What would have happened if the Soviets landed on the moon first?** This series is a well done dystopia. Initially, I thought it was light entertainment but it confronts current themes in a clever way. The second season is available, a third is on the way.

* **[Check For All Mankind on IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7772588/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}**

### Sound of Metal

**The life of Ruben, a metal drummer, falls apart when he suddenly loses his hearing.** I have yet to find the right words to describe this movie, and it’s fine. All the awards and nominations received are well earned.

* **[Check Sound of Metal on IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5363618/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}**

## What surprised me

### Entrepreneurship is broken

**A couple of men received backing for their idea that should help people that menstruate.** What am I talking about? A pair of gloves – pink, of course – that should make the act of removing tampons less gross. Nope, we don’t need it, thank you. **They should have read Erika Hall’s book.**

* **[Read the article _The tampon removal glove created by men that got investor backing is an example of a broken system_](https://womensagenda.com.au/latest/the-tampon-removal-glove-created-by-men-that-got-investor-backing-is-an-example-of-a-broken-system/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}**

### Pen and paper

As a person who likes almost everything digital and tech, I was surprised to read of **the study that suggests to use paper notebooks for information we need to learn or memorise**. Noted.

### Digital indigestion

**Simone Bossi, an Italian photographer, explains why he thinks digital photography is too much to digest.** His approach is fascinating: even if now it’s possible to take thousands of pictures of the same angle, he takes one. The pictures he took at the [Surrey Docks Farm](https://www.dezeen.com/2020/03/15/pup-architects-surrey-docks-farm-extension-architecture-london/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, the place down the road we used to live in London, are precious.

* **[Read the article _Digital photography is “too much to digest” says Simone Bossi_ on Dezeen](https://www.dezeen.com/2021/03/12/simone-bossi-architecture-photography-interview/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}**
