<p class="lead">Every couple of weeks, I write a letter to the nice people subscribed to <a href="https://us10.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=0c9027b00ef8ad1210adae70d&id=d77c0b18a8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Design, Digested</em></a>. Today, I want to share the latest with you. As there werenâ€™t any new blog posts or projects to announce, I didnâ€™t know what to write. Yet, I ended up writing a lot.</p>

I was initially embarrassed while thinking about what to tell you. Yet, what I read, watch and interests me everyday helps me grow. Or simply amuses me.

## Just Enough Research, by Erika Hall (second edition)

A cornerstone for anyone who wants to design the right thing for their clients. Useful and witty.

## Dove mi trovo, by Jhumpa Lahiri

My favourite author, who now writes in Italian too. This is her first Italian novel, out in English as _Whereabouts_. Iâ€™m devouring this short book where her classic themes of attachment and estrangement, nostalgia and solitude are at their peak.

## Silicon Valley

A TV series friends recommended years ago, that I watched only recently. Six brief series where a group of developers tries to build their start-up. Loads of laughing-out-loud moments, and a few annoying ones. Blink and itâ€™s the series finale, with nostalgia and a hint of sadness.

## For All Mankind

What would have happened if the Soviets landed on the moon first? This series is a well done dystopia. Initially, I thought it was light entertainment but it confronts current themes in a clever way. The second season is available, a third is on the way.

## Sound of Metal

The life of Ruben, a metal drummer, falls apart when he suddenly loses his hearing. I have yet to find the right words to describe this movie, and itâ€™s fine. All the awards and nominations received are well earned.

## Entrepreneurship is broken

A couple of men received backing for their idea that should help people that menstruate. What am I talking about? A pair of gloves â€“ pink, of course â€“ that should make the act of removing tampons less gross. Nope, we donâ€™t need it, thank you. They should have read Erika Hallâ€™s book.

### Pen and paper

As a person who likes almost everything digital and tech, I was surprised to read of the study that suggests to use paper notebooks for information we need to learn or memorise. Noted.

### Digital indigestion

Simone Bossi, an Italian photographer, explains why he thinks digital photography is too much to digest. His approach is fascinating: even if now itâ€™s possible to take thousands of pictures of the same angle, he takes one. The pictures he took at the [Surrey Docks Farm](https://www.dezeen.com/2020/03/15/pup-architects-surrey-docks-farm-extension-architecture-london/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, the place down the road we used to live in London, are precious.
