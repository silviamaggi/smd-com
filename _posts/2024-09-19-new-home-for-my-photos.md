For a long time [after quitting Instagram in 2021]({{ site.url }}/personal/deactivated-my-instagram-account), my photos were nowhere to be seen. Sometimes I would post a few pictures on my blog but it never felt quite right. I thought there had to be a reason to publish one or more pictures, or a similarity between them to build a story. 

With infinite gratitude to [Simone](https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/) for helping me so much, I am happy and proud to launch my new photography website, which will be designed in the open. The site is good enough to be online but there will be changes to the design and functionality in the future.

This approach helped me not to focus too much on small details, which would have delayed the publication. At the moment there are 10 photos, with more to come.

Technically, the site is a blog. Each photo is a single blog post, and albums are created based on the *place* category. There is an RSS feed that shows the photos in chronological order.

Having had a light-themed website for years, I opted for a darker one, following the thread of nature-inspired branding. I rely on the font Roboto Mono for readability on both desktop and mobile, and on the WebP format[^webp], which allows for images smaller in size than JPEGs.

Enjoy!
