## The Design Community Must Not Stay Silent

Harrison Wheeler invites the design community to use their power to question systems that are not right. We work with empathy, reasearch and solution-based approaches every day. It’s time we use the same techniques to find better ways to support and uplift our black neighbours, friends and colleagues.

## Designing For Belonging: Why Image Localization Matters

Music can be a unifying experience. But it’s also a personal and localized one, explains Nora Ahlenius. How do you make a global product feel inclusive and relevant for people all over the world? Spotify does representation well, through research, involving local experts, and by questioning bias.

## Cross-Cultural Design by Senongo Akpem

The web has always been worldwide, and yet this concept is relevant today more than ever. Our designs should be able to create rich experiences for everyone, regardless of location, language or identity.  If you’re curious about how our Western assumptions bias our design choices, this book is for you.

## The Culture Map: Breaking Through The Invisible Boundaries Of Global Business by Erin Meyer

Following on the topic of an ever more globalised world, this book is not much about design per se, but it helps navigate and decode the cultural differences within the context of business. Since work is likely to become remote for many in the design field, it is also plausible to spawn multicultural teams. A great opportunity to expand our mindset.
