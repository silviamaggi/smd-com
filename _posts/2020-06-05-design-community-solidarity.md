### The Culture Map: Breaking Through The Invisible Boundaries Of Global Business by Erin Meyer

Following on the topic of an ever more globalised world, this book is not much about design per se, but it helps navigate and decode the **cultural differences** within the context of **business**. Since work is likely to become **remote** for many in the design field, it is also plausible to spawn **multicultural** teams. A great opportunity to **expand** our **mindset**.
