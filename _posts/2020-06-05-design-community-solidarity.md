### The Design Community Must Not Stay Silent

Harrison Wheeler invites the **design community** to use their power to question systems that are not right. We work with **empathy**, **reasearch** and **solution**-based approaches every day. It’s time we use the same techniques to find better ways to **support** and **uplift** our black neighbours, friends and colleagues.

### Designing For Belonging: Why Image Localization Matters

Music can be a **unifying** experience. But it’s also a **personal** and **localized** one, explains Nora Ahlenius.

Spotify does **representation** well, through research, involving local experts, and by questioning **bias**.

The web has always been **worldwide**, and yet this concept is **relevant** today more than ever.

If you’re curious about how our Western **assumptions** bias our design choices, this book is for you.

### The Culture Map: Breaking Through The Invisible Boundaries Of Global Business by Erin Meyer

Following on the topic of an ever more globalised world, this book is not much about design per se, but it helps navigate and decode the **cultural differences** within the context of **business**. Since work is likely to become **remote** for many in the design field, it is also plausible to spawn **multicultural** teams. A great opportunity to **expand** our **mindset**.
