My main reading goal is [to avoid the daily and live news](https://silviamaggidesign.com/tag/news/), focusing instead on the many books I bought. I’ve been trying to go through my library with varying results, mainly disappointing, until the beginning of this year. Here is a list of what I read and what I’m reading now. The record started at the beginning of 2023, and the post will be constantly updated.

## In progress

- _Lady Susan_, by Jane Austen
- _To the Lighthouse_, Virginia Woolf
- _A Brief History of Time_, by Stephen Hawking
- _100 Things Every Designer Needs to Know About People_, by Susan Wienschenk
- _Ultra-Processed People_, by Chris van Tulleken [^UltraP]

## Finished

- _Exhalation_, by Ted Chiang[^TedChiang]
- _The Expats_, by Chris Pavone
- _Ariadne_, by Jennifer Saint
- _Flashforward_, by Robert J. Sawyer
- _Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?_, by Philip K. Dick
- _The Left Hand of Darkness_, by Ursula K. Le Guin
- _Saying Goodbye to Yang_, from _Children of the New World_, by Alexander Weinstein[^AfterYang]
- _Black Hole_, by Charles Burns
- _The Deception of Harriet Fleet_, by Helen Scarlett
- _Extra Bold – A Feminist, Inclusive, Anti-racist, Nonbinary Field Guide for Graphic Designers_, by multiple authors

- _The Norfolk Mystery_ by Ian Samson
- _Women & Power_ by Mary Beard

## Notes

[^UltraP]: Going very slowly with this, as it requires a state of mind I’m not always in.
[^AfterYang]: On which the beautiful film _After Yang_ is based on.
[^TedChiang]: A few stories included in this collection were already present in _Stories of Your Life and Others_, so this was a faster read.
