My main reading goal is [to avoid the daily and live news](https://silviamaggidesign.com/tag/news/), focusing instead on the many books I bought. I’ve been trying to go through my library with varying results, mainly disappointing, until the beginning of this year. Here is a list of what I read and what I’m reading now. The record started at the beginning of 2023, and the post will be constantly updated.

## In progress

- _Ariadne_, by Jennifer Saint
- _Flashforward_, by Robert J. Sawyer
