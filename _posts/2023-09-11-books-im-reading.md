My main goal is [to avoid the daily and live news]({{ site.url }}/tag/news/), and to focus instead on the books I bought. I’ve been trying to go through my library with varying results, mainly disappointing, until very recently. Here is my reading list. The record started at the beginning of 2023, and is constantly updated.

## In progress

- _Normal People_, by Sally Rooney
- _The Menopause Brain_, by Dr Lisa Mosconi

## Parked

Books I started to read, but don’t feel like continuing – for now.

- _To the Lighthouse_, Virginia Woolf
- _A Brief History of Time_, by Stephen Hawking
- _Ultra-Processed People_, by Chris van Tulleken [^UltraP]
- _The Happiness Trap_, by Russ Harris

## Notes

[^Alice]: Read it in English for the first time
[^UltraP]: Going very slowly with this, as it requires a state of mind I’m not always in.
[^AfterYang]: On which the beautiful film _After Yang_ is based on.
[^TedChiang]: A few stories included in this collection were already present in _Stories of Your Life and Others_, so this was a faster read.
