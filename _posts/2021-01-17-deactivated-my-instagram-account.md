<p class="lead">If it sounds like a big deal, it’s because it is. For someone passionate about photography, deciding to break with one of the most popular social networks might seem counter-productive.</p>

By not being on Instagram, I miss out on great pictures, knowing what my _online friends_ are up to, and lovely and funny conversations. The harsh reality is that when someone leaves a tool that almost everyone uses, it can be trickier to keep in touch. Sometimes it might even become impossible because the thing you had in common doesn’t connect you anymore.

## Attention, please

I’ve been feeling miserable on Instagram for a while. It felt like everything I had to do to stay relevant and get my content in front of people was a job in itself. And not a fulfilling one either.

This happens when **people’s attention and time are the product** for an app like Instagram. Once the advertisers are happy, everyone’s happy. Except for a lot of people trying to cope with the effects of comparison and feelings of not being enough.

Instagram’s new terms and conditions gave me the push I needed. Nothing is new or surprising there, considering its parent company is Facebook. Yet, they made me question what I want to do with my time and energy.

## Rules of engagement

A week in, I feel lighter and unburdened by the thought of what to post next, at what time, and what hashtags to use. The set of ever-changing “rules” to follow to make sure that posts get engagement, are plainly obscure, now that I see them from the outside. A mere pretext to keep people browsing.

Even if this blog never received much traffic from Instagram — except for the article about [Ravelry’s redesign](/design/ravelry-rebranding/){:title="View the article on my website"} — fewer people are going to see this post.

I miss the people and feeling part of something, even if sometimes it was about venting our frustrations with Instagram itself. It shows how the app’s design is successful: it triggers emotions, whether good or bad, and it keeps people there because that’s what creates a community.

## What now?

Without even wanting it, I started the new year by cleaning up my digital life. I deleted my Facebook, WhatsApp, Pinterest and Goodreads accounts. Finally, I deactivated the Instagram one. Last summer I left Twitter. It’s possible to spend too much time on LinkedIn, but that account stays.

What I could never be able to delete is [my Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/silvia-m/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="View my profile on Flickr"}, even when I didn’t use it for long periods. The reasons are both emotional and practical: I have many pictures and memories organised in albums. When I browse them, I can see the progress made in photography and where I was in my life.

While Instagram main interest switched to creators, brands and what they sell, **Flickr never changed its focus on photography**. I re-started from there, without feeling the urge to post something.
