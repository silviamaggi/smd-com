description: "I deactivated my Instagram account. What now? If it sounds like a big a deal, it's because it is. My first week post-Instagram."
excerpt: 'If it sounds like a big deal, it‚Äôs because it is. For someone passionate about photography, deciding to break with one of the most popular social networks might seem counter-productive.'

By not being on Instagram, I miss out on great pictures, knowing what my _online friends_ are up to, and lovely and funny conversations. The harsh reality is that when someone leaves a tool that almost everyone uses, it can be trickier to keep in touch. Sometimes it might even become impossible because the thing you had in common doesn‚Äôt connect you anymore.

## Attention, please

I‚Äôve been feeling miserable on Instagram for a while. It felt like everything I had to do to stay relevant and get my content in front of people was a job in itself. And not a fulfilling one either.

This happens when **people‚Äôs attention and time are the product** for an app like Instagram. Once the advertisers are happy, everyone‚Äôs happy. Except for a lot of people trying to cope with the effects of comparison and feelings of not being enough.

Instagram‚Äôs new terms and conditions gave me the push I needed. Nothing is new or surprising there, considering its parent company is Facebook. Yet, they made me question what I want to do with my time and energy.

## Rules of engagement

A week in, I feel lighter and unburdened by the thought of what to post next, at what time, and what hashtags to use. The set of ever-changing ‚Äúrules‚Äù to follow to make sure that posts get engagement, are plainly obscure, now that I see them from the outside. A mere pretext to keep people browsing.

Even if this blog never received much traffic from Instagram ‚Äî except for the article about [Ravelry‚Äôs redesign](/design/ravelry-rebranding/){:title="View the article on my website"} ‚Äî fewer people are going to see this post.

I miss the people and feeling part of something, even if sometimes it was about venting our frustrations with Instagram itself. It shows how the app‚Äôs design is successful: it triggers emotions, whether good or bad, and it keeps people there because that‚Äôs what creates a community.

## What now?

Without even wanting it, I started the new year by cleaning up my digital life. I deleted my Facebook, WhatsApp, Pinterest and Goodreads accounts. Finally, I deactivated the Instagram one. Last summer I left Twitter. It‚Äôs possible to spend too much time on LinkedIn, but that account stays.

What I could never be able to delete is [my Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/silvia-m/){:title="View my profile on Flickr"}, even when I didn‚Äôt use it for long periods. The reasons are both emotional and practical: I have many pictures and memories organised in albums. When I browse them, I can see the progress made in photography and where I was in my life.

While Instagram main interest switched to creators, brands and what they sell, **Flickr never changed its focus on photography**. I re-started from there, without feeling the urge to post something.

        <span>It must be so freeing to leave social media. It now forms the basis of my job, and I enjoy many aspects of it, but there are question marks too. I'm looking forward to finding out how your response to that world changes over time x</span>

        <span>Who knows what will be: big tech might need to adapt to stricter rules, and social networks might change as a consequence. So far, though, I‚Äôm not missing any of them. Such was the prominence of social media in my life, that I feel so much lighter now. I also stopped checking the news multiple times a day, and I completely avoid live news feeds. The background noise is gone. It is freeing indeed x</span>

        <span>Silvia I can understand your reasons for leaving entirely, I too question social media‚Äôs role in my life and endeavour to be extremely conscious of the way that I use it. I‚Äôm trying to make clear decisions about how I will use it going forwards, but do reassure myself that there are other ways of keeping in touch with one another! x</span>

        <span>Hi Vanessa, it's nice to see you here! Whatever you decide, I can assure you that there definitively are ways of keeping in touch, it's just a matter of finding the right ones. I believe with social media we got used to keep in touch using tools that seem irreplaceable, but there are alternatives. x</span>
