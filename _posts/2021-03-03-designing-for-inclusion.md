What does it mean designing for inclusion? Inclusive design is gaining a lot of attention lately, and rightly so. The following articles and resources are a good start to understand how biases influence our work and what to pay attention to when starting a new project.

For Stacie Sheldon, an American Indian UX professional, it all starts with words.

> Inclusive design makes people feel welcome, safe, and valued. It prevents frustration and demeaning experiences. It remembers that language has power.
>
> <cite>Stacie Sheldon – <strong>From scientific racism to inclusive design</strong></cite>

Designing for inclusion also means thinking about how the design of content can create barriers for some people.

> […] regardless of the tactics, designing inclusive content models begins by acknowledging the political work that these models perform and asking whom they include or exclude from participation.
>
> <cite>Daniel Carter, Carra Martinez – <strong>Designing Inclusive Content Models</strong></cite>
