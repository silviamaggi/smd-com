For Stacie Sheldon, an American Indian UX professional, it all starts with words.

> Inclusive design makes people feel welcome, safe, and valued. It prevents frustration and demeaning experiences. It remembers that language has power.
>
> <cite>Stacie Sheldon â€“ <strong>From scientific racism to inclusive design</strong></cite>

Designing for inclusion also means thinking about how the design of content can create barriers for some people.

> [â€¦] regardless of the tactics, designing inclusive content models begins by acknowledging the political work that these models perform and asking whom they include or exclude from participation.

> <cite>Daniel Carter, Carra Martinez â€“ <strong>Designing Inclusive Content Models</strong></cite>
