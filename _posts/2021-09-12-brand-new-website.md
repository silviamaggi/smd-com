<p class="lead">About a month after <a href="{{ site.url }}/personal/leaving-wordpress/">announcing it</a>, I'm excited to welcome you to my new virtual house. Can I offer you a drink?</p>

<!--more-->

<a href="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Simone</a> and I built my new website from scratch using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} — a static site generator — and <a href="{{ site.url }}/colophon/">several other tools</a>. It means *I now have complete control over its code*. It felt natural to refresh logo and styling as well, like it often happens during a home restoration. I made some important changes, too. Let me show you around.

## Lock, stock, and barrel

Ever since the early 2000s, I've been writing on blogs. I used to design and develop them until it felt like a massive task. Thus, I started to use WordPress. When social media came, I **scattered my thoughts and pictures** over various third party platforms. Later, I created a photography site, followed by my work portfolio. I tried to combine the two, without much convinction.

Every time I separated my passions, I ended up not writing, or not taking photos because of some perceived pressure to deliver a specific kind of content. Enter this website, where there's everything I like. Here, you'll find:

<ul class="smd-ul">
<li>the design inspiration series <a href="{{ site.url }}/category/design-digested/"><em>Design, Digested</em></a>;</li>
<li><a href="{{ site.url }}/category/photography/">photography posts</a>, including some earlier ones that I never published on my design website;</li>
<li>my <a href="{{ site.url }}/silvia-maggi-portfolio/">work and side projects</a>;</li>
<li>the special section <a href="{{ site.url }}/jeremybearimy/"><em>Jeremy Bearimy</em></a> where time flows differently.</li>
</ul>

## Spark joy

Moving the content from WordPress to Jekyll — and within a new layout — meant every post, photo, case study, underwent a **major overhaul**. Helped by Simone's expertise with editing, I kept what still made sense, rewrote what didn't look good, and found a more relaxed way to emphasise text. Featured images are missing from most of my posts: there is one when it has meaning, not for the sake of <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr>. 

My database on WordPress ballooned, so I seized the opportunity to delete useless tags and categories, reorganising the information architecture of the blog. If you like numbers, I used to have <code>303</code> tags! Most of which were, of course, barely used. You can find the renewed taxonomy in the footer menu, under <em>Archive</em>.

{% include pattern-figure-featured.html image="/assets/images/smd-footer.jpg" alt="Silvia Maggi Design website footer menu" caption="The footer menu containing the archive" width="754" height="149" %}

## Sustainability

Speaking of ballooning, a special mention about the *weight* of the website: the previous version, on WordPress, was <code>1.08 Gb</code>, compared to the current <code>53.6 Mb</code>. 

In his book *Webwaste*, Gerry McGovern explains how the web changed since 1994. The number of websites, the weight of pages, third-party content and scripts hanging off them, all contribute to increasing our digital waste. Which, in turn, **creates pollution**. It's an issue I care about, which made me finally decide to do my part. I first mentioned the book in <a href="/design-digested/biased-ai/"><em>Design, Digested #7</em></a>.

## No cookies here

Would you like a <em>pasticcino</em> (pastitˈtʃino)  instead?

This website does not collect any personal data about visitors. I painstakingly deleted any kind of tracking from the links I share with you, and every YouTube video comes from <code>https://www.youtube-nocookie.com</code>. After much thinking, I decided not to implement a comment system, and chose to give you the ability to **reply directly to me** at the end of each post. Your messages will land in my inbox, where we can have a private conversation. This is another reason why there is no need for cookies. More details on the <a href="{{ site.url }}/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy page</a>.

## What's cooking

Deploying the site is a first step, but there is still a lot to do. Here's a quick list of what's next:

<ul class="smd-ul">
<li>import comments from the previous website version;</li>
<li>implement <a href="https://indieweb.org/Webmention" title="Read about Webmentions on IndieWeb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Webmentions</a>;</li>
<li>join <a href="https://indieweb.org/" title="Go to the IndieWeb website" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indieweb</a>.</li>
</ul>

Stop by again soon, I will tell you more.
