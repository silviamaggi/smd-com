## Performing Goodness: The rise of ‘ethical theater’ in UX

> Ethics has become a buzzword in the design industry. But what happens when our dedication to ethical “best practices” is nothing more than a performance—a way to spotlight our goodness while masking our harm? If we truly want to challenge the status quo, we need to lift the curtain on ethical theater.

## What we've learned about designing for accessibility from our users

> Slack’s accessibility team recently launched a series of changes to make navigating around Slack more reliable and efficient for keyboard-only and screen reader users. While our accessibility had significantly improved over the last few years, we were still hearing from blind and low-vision users that moving around the interface felt disorienting and noisy. One user likened it to trying to find a specific object in an open, busy gymnasium. Talk about frustrating.

## Swearing and automatic captions

> The inclusion of a swear is a deliberate act. Its removal undoes the speaker’s agency, and dilutes the message they’re trying to communicate.

## The good line-height

> Have you ever needed to create a type scale following an 8 point baseline grid, or really any grid, and had to spend extra time figuring out what should be the right line-height for every text size in the scale?
