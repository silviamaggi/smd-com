## The Hook Model: when our hormones work against us

> Youâ€™re probably subjected to it whether you know it or not. The book that introduced the Hook model has sold over 250K copies in over 20 languages. This framework aims to maximise engagement on a product, which is techspeak for making you spend as much time as possible on it, making you visit as many pages as possible, maximising the number of daily active users, etc. We are prone to this model because it leverages the specific way our brain has been moulded to ensure our survival. For all that, we can still learn to protect ourselves against it.
