description: "A note about mammography, pain, and possible new designs to make the examination more comfortable and less painful for people of all ages."
excerpt: "This morning I went for a mammography. In Italy, the examination is offered for prevention from the age of 40."

In the UK itâ€™s offered starting from the age of 50. It wasnâ€™t my first time, though, as I had one during a senology visit when I lived in Cambridge and was just under 40. Why does it have to be so painful and uncomfortable? Didnâ€™t anyone thought of a better way to perform the same test? A quick search revealed that someone did. 

Many hospitals and diagnostic centres are still using the technology invented in the 60s, while a few teams are coming up with alternatives. [3D imaging is already a thing](https://www.ge.com/news/reports/this-nuclear-physicist-is-using-her-skills-and-passion-to-build-a-better-mammography-machine "Read the article on General Electric"), although it doesn't solve the pain issue. 

The innovation that caught my interest comes from The Netherlands, where PA Imaging are developing _"photo-acoustic mammography, enabling breast cancer screening for all women, irrespective of age"_. Exciting.
