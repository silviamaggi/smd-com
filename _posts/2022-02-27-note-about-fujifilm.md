description: 'Fujufilm cameras internal battery resets the device when left without charge for too long.'
excerpt: 'Fujifilm cameras have an internal battery built to retain the settings. If left too long without the main battery inserted, it will empty, resetting the camera.'

I didn't find any information about how long the internal battery lasts, but the last time I used the camera was five months ago.

<ul class="smd-ul">
  <li>Use the camera more, or keep it charged;</li>
  <li>Backup the settings.</li>
</ul>
