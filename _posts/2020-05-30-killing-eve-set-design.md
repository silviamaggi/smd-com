## Dressing Scenes For Killing Eve Was ‚ÄúLike Finding Treasure‚Äù, Says Set Decorator

The third series of *Killing Eve* is out. I have yet to watch it, and this article tickled my curiosity. Set decorator Casey Williams explains how set design and location choices were key to express the radically different lifestyles of Eve Polastri and Villanelle. It‚Äôs fascinating to read how nothing is left to chance, and how every little detail serves the purpose of telling the story of each character.

Do you know how _text-to-speech_ software react to emojis and custom font? If not, you‚Äôre likely to be surprised. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and LinkedIn provide accessible tools. Alexa explains how to use them.

## Bad Design vs. Good Design: 5 Examples We Can Learn From

Design is what determines a good or bad experience on websites and, either consciously or unconsciously, we know what we like or not. But, can we tell why? Being able to critique other people‚Äôs design choices helps us to understand the reasons behind our reactions to online experiences. Most of us have websites now and, whether you‚Äôre a designer or not, there are ways to make yours a place where people are likely to visit again.

## Planned Obsolescence, by Unusable podcast

Do you remember when it was possible to change the battery of a car or phone without asking a professional? Or when you [didn‚Äôt have to buy](/design/pandemic-opportunity-for-change/){:title="Read the post 'The pandemic is a massive opportunity for change' on my website"} a new fridge-freezer when one of the two parts broke?

Planned obsolescence is the practise of designing products with a short expiry date. David and Andrew explain how it works, present us with seven types of planned obsolescence and many other interesting examples.
