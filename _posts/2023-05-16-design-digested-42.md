## The difference between iteration and prototyping

> When building software products, we often hear two separate phrases with different meanings used interchangeably: iteration and prototyping. They're not the same thing, but they're related over time during a build process.

## Designing for (realistic) attention

>  When I advise that a webpage â€” like a service detail page â€” have a maximum main body word-count of 150 words, Iâ€™m really recommending that it ask a reader to commit to 30 seconds. To put that in perspective, a 1,500 word article â€” the type of thing weâ€™ve historically written with SEO in mind â€” could take ~6-10 minutes to read. Fewer and fewer people are doing that, even though search engine algorithms reward length.

## How to think better: the skill youâ€™ve never been taught

> Good decisions make the future easier, bad ones make it harder.<br>
> But <em>how</em> can we learn to think better?

## Diaries of note

> Every day, beginning on 1st January 2023, a new (old) diary entry will be published on Diaries of Note, with each entry appearing on the same day and month as it was originally written. Every single diarist will be differentâ€”nobody will appear twiceâ€”which means that by 31st December 2023 you will have been transported back in time by 365 people.
