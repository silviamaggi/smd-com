description: "It’s not true I can work from anywhere, despite owning a laptop. It heavily depends on the condition of my surroundings."
excerpt: "The answer to the following question should always be: <em>it depends</em>. As in UX design."

> Because of the work you do, you can work from anywhere, right? You simply need a laptop.

It’s a concept I helped spreading, because it's technically true. I don’t necessarily need to physically be in an office to work with my colleagues and stick to deadlines. Yet, there is one thing I desperately need: quiet. 

As it happens, quiet is a commodity that is sorely lacking in my life. Italy is a very loud country: very broadly speaking – because of course there are exceptions – people’s conversations are louder, their phones are louder, as are their TVs and places of work.

This reality is impossible not to notice when spending a certain amount of time abroad living like a local. Immerse yourself in a culture where tranquillity is appreciated, and it’ll be difficult to adjust to previous customs.

It surely happened to me as I moved back to Italy after living almost 10 years in the UK. I’ve spent a considerable amount of money and time protecting my hearing and concentration: 

- buying expensive noise-cancelling headphones and earplugs,
- moving from one place to the other,
- trying to calm down when the noise is unbearable (e.i. when the neighbours transform their place to a rave party).

It’s possible that the same situation is valid in other countries, and I mostly blame it on the disrespectful use of social media and portable devices. Culture also plays a part, as usual. Something that’s common in a place can be unacceptable in another. And then there’s me and few others, the square pegs in round holes.

At least today I've managed to write this post.
