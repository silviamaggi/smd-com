An announcement to my WordPress followers.

Soon, I’ll be starting a process to move away from WordPress: **my website will have a new house, look, and ways to be managed**.

This means that my blog posts won’t appear in your feed anymore and, if you’re following me via email, you’ll stop receiving them in your inbox.

At the moment, I don’t have an alternative to provide, so **the best way to keep in touch would be to sign up to my mailing list using the form below**.

Leaving is a bittersweet sensation, as it’s been countless years since I’ve had my first WordPress site. **But the idea of building a website from scratch**, using different and lighter technology, similarly to what I used to do in the early 2000s **is nonetheless exciting**.

The new site will be based on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"}, and hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"}.

I don’t have a precise timeline, but the switch will probably happen in a month or two. See you on the other side?

In the meantime, take care.
