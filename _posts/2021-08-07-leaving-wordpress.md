This means that my blog posts won’t appear in your feed anymore and, if you’re following me via email, you’ll stop receiving them in your inbox. At the moment, I don’t have an alternative to provide, so the best way to keep in touch would be to sign up to my mailing list. 

Leaving is a bittersweet sensation, as it’s been countless years since I’ve had my first WordPress site. But the idea of building a website from scratch, using different and lighter technology, similarly to what I used to do in the early 2000s is nonetheless exciting. 

The new site will be based on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:title="Go to the Jekyll website"}, and hosted by [Netlify](https://netlify.com/){:title="Go to Netlify"}. I don’t have a precise timeline, but the switch will probably happen in a month or two. See you on the other side?
