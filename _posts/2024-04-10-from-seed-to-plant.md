excerpt: "One of the things I missed most of our life in Cambridge is growing vegetables and flowers. Having a garden is a lot of work, but itâ€™s highly rewarding."

Simone and I have been busy preparing for spring during the last few weekends. Weâ€™ve found the mint we planted years ago, moved it to the other side of the garden, and are watching it thrive. From seeds, we planted:

- the romanesco variety of courgettes, which is sweeter and tastier
- chives
- chillies
- plum tomatoes
- parsley
- rocket salad
- red lettuce
- garlic
- mixed flowers

The next project is to reinstate grass where the lawn suffered. Having adopted a more relaxed approach, most of the moss is going to stay anyway. It looks good, itâ€™s soft, and I like to think that itâ€™s home to many tardigrades.

At the edges of the lawn, many wild plants are benefiting from our new approach, as we didnâ€™t weed them out. Their flowers are going to help insects, and are beautiful to our eyes. I now see a contradiction in wanting to have a garden, and keeping it too tidy. It might be green, but it probably wonâ€™t be teeming with life.

The previous tenants planted some gorgeous tulips, and more daffodils, which weâ€™re now enjoying. These days, the Spanish bluebells are flowering.

Seeing life growing before my eyes makes me happy. Being in touch with nature has always been important, even more so now, this moment in time when we need hope.
