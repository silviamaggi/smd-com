## Tools for better thinking

A collection of thinking tools and frameworks to help you solve problems, make decisions and understand systems by Adam Amran.

## Digital ethics and moral theory explained

> Itâ€™s not always obvious how the idea of ethics should merge with the very broad concept of digital technology. Especially when the word ethics brings to mind a whole field of academia rooted in ideas brought forth by greek philosophers. This is my contribution to framing digital ethics in a way that makes it more useful for everyday work with digital products and services.<cite>Per Axbom</cite>

## Annotating designs for accessibility

A majority of the accessibility issues that plague websites originates from the design phase. Our designs and prototypes can communicate many core aspects of accessible design, but many others can get lost. Anna E. Cook presented accessibility annotations during a workshop at [a11yTO](https://noti.st/events/iW33vx/a11yto "Accessibility Toronto") in October 2022 in Toronto, Canada.

## Web apps: why offering a low contrast mode makes you more accessible, not less

Tiia Aurora explains how the current high contrast standard actively locks out users from accessing web apps. Another great example of how the accessibility check tools and guidelines can be limited, and how accessibility can never be 100% accessible for everyone.
