> With this origin in the printing process, today the word stereotype refers to a simplified, derogatory view of a group of people. Stereotypical ideas about race, gender, or ethnicity are repeated again and again in culture with little effort at understanding, just as stereotyped printing plates can be used repeatedly and at low cost. A stereotype about race or gender is a shorthand way of simplifying and flattening identity.
A clichÃ© is also a lazy habit of language, a clever phrase beaten down by overuse.
