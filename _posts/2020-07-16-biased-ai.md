## The Future Is TransFeminist: from Imagination to Action

My friend [Mel](https://thebookfamilyrogerson.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} pointed me to this article, saying that it ties in with my thinking, and sheâ€™s right. Joana Varonâ€™s question is: *what would the future look like if algorithms that command our daily interactions were developed based on feminist values?* The article is a deep dive into feminism, the internet, video games, social media and much more. Itâ€™s a compelling read.

The number of websites, the weight of pages and third-party webpages hanging off them, all contribute to increasing our digital weight. Which, in turn, creates pollution. Time to tidy up.
