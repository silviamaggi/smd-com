## The Future Is TransFeminist: from Imagination to Action

My friend [Mel](https://thebookfamilyrogerson.com/){:title="Go to The Family Rogerson's website"} pointed me to this article, saying that it ties in with my thinking, and she’s right. Joana Varon’s question is: *what would the future look like if algorithms that command our daily interactions were developed based on feminist values?* The article is a deep dive into feminism, the internet, video games, social media and much more. It’s a compelling read.

## Biased AI Perpetuates Racial Injustice

In her article for TechCrunch, Miriam Vogel explains how AI exacerbates racism and disparities. Machines are neutral and scientific, but, if AI teams are not diverse and educated on ethics and in recognising bias, they become a mirror that reflects the defects of our society.

## Webwaste

_A List Apart_ shared an excerpt from Chapter 9 of Gerry McGovern’s Book _World Wide Waste_, a fascinating read on how the web changed since 1994. The number of websites, the weight of pages, third-party content and scripts hanging off them, all contribute to increasing our digital waste. Which, in turn, creates pollution. Time to tidy up.

        <span>If there ever was a good time for leaving social media and build a more sane digital life, it is now. Great resources, as always. I'm currently reading Lanier's book on my Kobo and it's extraordinary.</span>

        <span>Thank you! Staying away from social media seems like the right choice, especially during this moment in time. Not sure which I’ll delete, or when, but staying away feels already liberating. </span>
