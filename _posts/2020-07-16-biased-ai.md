### The Future Is TransFeminist: from Imagination to Action

My friend [Mel](https://thebookfamilyrogerson.com/){:target="_blank"} recently pointed me to this article, saying that it ties in with my thinking, and she’s right. Joana Varon’s question is: what would the future look like if **algorithms** that command our daily interactions were developed based on **feminist values**? The article is a deep dive into feminism, the internet, video games, social media and much more. It’s a compelling read.

### Biased AI Perpetuates Racial Injustice

In her article for TechCrunch, Miriam Vogel explains how **AI** exacerbates **racism** and **disparities**.

### Webwaste

_A List Apart_ shared an excerpt from Chapter 9 of Gerry McGovern’s Book _World Wide Waste_, a fascinating read on how the web changed since 1994. The **number** of websites, the weight of pages and third-party webpages hanging off them, all contribute to increasing our **digital weight**. Which, in turn, creates **pollution**. Time to tidy up.
