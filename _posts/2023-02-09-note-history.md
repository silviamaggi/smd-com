> History isnâ€™t everything that ever happened.
It is a selective set of narratives that have been recorded and passed on. Writing history is a process of making connections among people, events, and broad social changes. Official histories focus on a societyâ€™s most visible and dominant figuresâ€”kings, generals, business magnates, and famous artists, inventors, statesmen, and explorers. Todayâ€™s historians are studying the achievements of overlooked people and practices in order to create decolonized histories, queer histories, gendered histories, local histories, disability histories, and histories of popular culture.
