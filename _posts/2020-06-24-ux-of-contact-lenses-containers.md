How is the **UX** **of** **contact lenses containers**? It’s easy to overlook what we use daily, and yet everyday things are usually the ones that make us feel **frustrated**.

<!--more-->

A few months ago, I switched my multipurpose lens solution from a famous brand to an off-brand. Everything went smoothly, until I put the right lens into my left eye, and viceversa.

This little mishap prompted me to understand what went wrong. Of course, I might have been sleepier than usual, or still used to the other brand’s containers. The fact is, I thought my eyesight deteriorated significantly overnight (ouch!).

## Comparing Contact Lenses Containers

Something was off. After a quick [search](https://www.google.com/search?q=contact+lenses+container&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjp4vyNu5rqAhVeRxUIHdhLDDAQ_AUoAnoECCEQBA&biw=1261&bih=733&dpr=2){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (the link opens a Google search window), I found out that the containers look very similar – excluding the novelty ones. They usually have two colours and one letter on at least one lid, just like the one I was using.

The colours of the lids are switched, and the letters on the off-brand lids are thinner.

An important detail that is missing from the off-brand container is the curved shape of the bottom of the single containers.

These details affect the **UX of the contact lenses containers**. How?

## UX and Usability Considerations

One important consideration is for people with **colour blindness**. Either they won’t be able to recognise the **colour**, or it’ll be less meaningful to them.

Another important consideration is about the **typeface**. For many, it’ll be tricky to distinguish which letter is on the lid when the typeface is too **thin** or **small**.

The curved shape is significant because it makes it possible to tell which side should be in front of the person through a **visual** and **tactile experience**.

The shape and the letter L for _left_ combined with the colour of the right lid are the crucial elements that **define** the **user experience** of the contact lenses container. When their implementation is correct, I know that I’m going to apply my lenses **correctly**.

## Conclusions

Always give people **more than one way** to achieve their goals, and avoid relying on non-universal features like colour.

Sometimes, sticking to pre-existing **conventions** is good, but it doesn’t necessarily mean never to **innovate**. Give people enough **clues** and test, test, test.

Norman. It’s a compelling read for anyone interested in design, psychology and understanding what makes the user experience of everyday things good as opposed to bad.
