## On Nielsen’s ideas about generative UI for resolving accessibility
> "Accessibility has failed as a way to make computers usable for disabled users." Thus begins a newsletter by Jakob Nielsen. And had it not been written by someone a great many people take seriously in the UX industry I likely would just have dismissed it.

Jakob Nielsen makes a potentially harmful case for generative UI in his latest newsletter, while alienating accessibility experts. I won’t link his post here. Instead, Per Axom took the time to analyse it and write why he thinks it’s "misleading, self-contradictory and underhanded". Both Nielsen and [Don Norman]({{ site.url }}/tag/don-norman/) have shared problematic views, and it’s high time we stop idolising them.

## In loving memory of square checkbox
> Apple is the first major operating system vendor who had abandoned a four-decades-long tradition. Their new visionOS — for the first time in the history of Apple — will have round checkboxes.

Just because Apple (or Google, or any other Big Tech company) do it, does not mean it’s right.

## The beauty of everyday things
> [&hellip;] Yanagi was bemoaning the “cheapness” that machine manufacture was already bringing to everyday things. He had several criteria for these everyday miscellaneous things and all of them are worth revisiting because we now know that some things are best when precision machined and manufactured and other things benefit from showing sings of a human hand at work.

Fascinating essay on the handmade objects, and the machine-made consumer objects, that we use every day.
