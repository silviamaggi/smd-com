> There is nothing inherently bad about using a framework, a pre- or postprocessor, or any other tool to help ease your front-end development workflow. In the real world, we have to ship quickly, build things with unrealistic budgets, and deal with that client who insists a site look “the same” in IE8 as in the latest version of Chrome.  
> But if all your front-end development is in your preferred framework, how long will it be until you can’t remember how to sit down in front of a text editor and build a layout from scratch? How do you find out about new approaches and new specifications? How much are you limiting your creativity to whatever the framework you use enables?
