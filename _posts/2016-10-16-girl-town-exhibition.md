_GIRL TOWN_ is a selected exhibition of photography celebrating the culture of the female in the 21st Century. Itâ€™s been curated through Instagram, so it is possible to see all the entries by exploring the hashtag `#girltownPM`. The selected 200 photos are visible at the lovely St Margaretâ€™s House, London, until 1st November 2016.

_GIRL TOWN_ is also a series of talks, meetups, films screenings. Programme and other information [here](https://shutterhub.org.uk/blog/girltownpm){:title="Read more on the Shutter Hub website"}. The exhibition already got very good press and, the night of the opening, it was announced that next year itâ€™ll be going to Tel Aviv. I couldnâ€™t have imagined a better result!
