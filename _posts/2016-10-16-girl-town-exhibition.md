_GIRL TOWN_ is a selected exhibition of photography celebrating the culture of the female in the 21st Century. It’s been curated through Instagram, so it is possible to see all the entries by exploring the hashtag `#girltownPM`. The selected 200 photos are visible at the lovely St Margaret’s House, London, until 1st November 2016.

_GIRL TOWN_ is also a series of talks, meetups, films screenings. Programme and other information [here](https://shutterhub.org.uk/blog/girltownpm){:title="Read more on the Shutter Hub website"}. The exhibition already got very good press and, the night of the opening, it was announced that next year it’ll be going to Tel Aviv. I couldn’t have imagined a better result!
