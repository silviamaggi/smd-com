## Design thinking was supposed to fix the world. Where did it go wrong?

> An approach that promised to democratize design may have done the opposite.

## 36 seconds that changed everything

> _36 Seconds That Changed Everything_ is an audio documentary, written and produced by Texas-based writer, Shelly Brisbin. It tells the story of how a device that once excluded people with disabilities â€“ the iPhone â€“ became one of the most transformative forces in the lives of those same people, once the barriers its software had created were removed.

## Accessible but never boring

> Thereâ€™s a misconception that making a product accessible means sacrificing the visual design. Your UI will look too plain, they say. Your branding too dry, or too ugly. But gone are the days when you had to look like a boring bank to build a product that can be used by all. Itâ€™s time to think bigger. Bold brands embrace accessibility.

## Visual frameworks

> Visual frameworks are pictorial mental models that can help you clarify your thoughts. Each visual framework is like a building block. You can combine and configure them in different ways to think and build shared understanding about situations, challenges, strategies and plans.
