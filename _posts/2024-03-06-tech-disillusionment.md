description: "How and why I became disillusioned with technology."
excerpt: "Technology no longer excites me. To be precise, I’m not able to feel enthusiastic about new technology anymore. Might be because I’m getting older."

I went through many digital tools and hardware in the past, had my favourites, and was prepared to defend them when needed (Apple vs Microsoft, iPhone vs Android). I was a *fangirl*.

Has technology changed? In fact, the word *enshittification* was coined by Cory Doctorow[^shit] to define what happens to online platforms that “function as two-sided market”. It describes precisely what happened to services and products like Amazon, Facebook, Google Search, Twitter, Bandcamp, Reddit, Uber and Unity:

> Here is how platforms die: first, they are good to their users; then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers; finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves. Then, they die. I call this enshittification, and it is a seemingly inevitable consequence arising from the combination of the ease of changing how a platform allocates value, combined with the nature of a "two sided market", where a platform sits between buyers and sellers, hold each hostage to the other, raking off an ever-larger share of the value that passes between them.
<cite>Cory Doctorow</cite>

Is it any wonder that free digital products made by companies funded by venture capitalists would worsen their offering while abusing their users? I believe most of the signs are there from the beginning. Let’s call it an open-air sewage that we try to ignore until the stink becomes too strong, or the fields around it are poisoned. The truth is, if something’s free, you’re the product.

My disillusionment is no good news for *Design, Digested*. Too many people write either on platforms that require an account, or a subscription. In any case, there’s a high chance the platform is also problematic[^substack]. The best case scenario involves articles where you’ll be forced to go through annoying  banners nagging you to subscribe. I don’t like that, so why should I share them?

I’ve been making an effort to look for blog posts from people who share them on their personal websites. There are plenty, so the choice is not an issue. My need to stay away from screens, with the inevitable bad news, polarising discussions and culture wars, though, is another matter.
