description: 'Nature and a shallow depth of field create one of my favourite photography style. Here I present four pictures that make me happy.'
excerpt: 'During the past sweltering weekend, I looked for a few pictures to make my website more personal: not many other things in photography make me happy as nature and a shallow depth of field.'

As my main website is purely for introduction to my work and experience, I didn‚Äôt want big photos to steal the visitor‚Äôs attention. But they needed to represent me, which I think they do.

I took them a few years ago when we first planted meadow flowers in our garden. It was also the first time we gave a shot at growing tomatoes from seeds. Good memories.

The swirly effect in most of the pictures is courtesy of the [Helios 44M lens](https://vintage-camera-lenses.com/helios-44-2-58mm-f2/){:title="Go to the Vintage Camera Lenses website"} that I use when there is plenty of time to compose and take the shot. It feels like carefully crafting something important. That is one of the factors that make me happy about them.

        <span>I love the first photo. Amazing red flowers, and such intensity in the main object of focus.</span>

        <span>Thank you so much, Amanda! That photo is my favourite too. We never had those beautiful flowers again in our garden, so I'm glad I took the picture.</span>
