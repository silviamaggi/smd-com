## GIRL TOWN moved to Tel Aviv, Israel, where it ran from 8 February to 9 March 2018 at the Alfred Gallery.

Originally presented at Photomonth East London International Photography Festival in 2016, the show celebrates the culture of the female in the 21th century.

Initially, the exhibition was curated on Instagram, and I’ve been proudly part of it ever since the beginning.
