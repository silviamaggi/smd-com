Originally presented at Photomonth East London International Photography Festival in 2016, the show celebrates the culture of the female in the 21th century.

Initially, the exhibition was curated on Instagram, and I’ve been proudly part of it ever since the beginning. Shutter Hub shared impressions, reactions and photos from the private view.
