I could never thank enough the lovely people at Shutter Hub, for the wonderful and exciting opportunity. Itâ€™s been an honour for me to be a contributor to such an amazing event.

Along with the exhibition, a series of interesting and well-organised meet-ups, talks, workshops and portfolio reviews took place.

Iâ€™ve had the chance to meet with talented photographers and local creatives, and I look forward to the next yearâ€™s exhibition.
