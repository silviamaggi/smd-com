<p class="lead">Newsletter changes, pages and falling leaves.</p>

<!--more-->

<ul class="smd-ul">
  <li>Last week, I created the <a href="https://silviamaggidesign.com/newsletter/archive/">Newsletter Archive</a> section on my site. It follows my decision to leave Mailchimp and manage the <em>Design, Digested</em> newsletters on my own. As one of my biggest pet-peeves is how <a href="https://silviamaggidesign.com/tag/social-media/" title="Visit the Social Media posts archive">social media</a> track us, eroding our online <a href="https://silviamaggidesign.com/tag/privacy/" title="Visit the Social Media posts archive">privacy</a>, it seemed hypocritical of me to use a service that tracks its users. I'm happier not knowing what you clicked or when, even if it means going against every marketing best practice. <a href="https://silviamaggidesign.com/newsletter/archive/newsletter-32/">Read my last letter (from Mailchimp)</a>.</li>
  <li>I made a quick balance of the books read this year: they're four so far. Much less than I hoped, but it's still an achievement compared to the previous years. Although I have a long queue of reads spanning from novels to UX/technical, so the number might increase soon.</li>
  <li>Today is one of those very rainy days in Milan. Colours look so much better. Autumn is in full swing, as you can see from the pictures I took on Saturday at the park.</li>
