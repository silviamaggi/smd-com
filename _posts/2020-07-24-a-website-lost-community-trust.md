In this inspiration series: a well-known website lost community trust with a redesign that didn’t take into account its users with disabilities.

Something important took space in my mind during the past week: **web accessibility**.

<!--more-->

In a moment when people spend more time at home and need to _be_ and _feel_ **connected**, we realise what a privilege it is to have a good internet connection. Tim Berners-Lee, who invented the World Wide Web, made it clearer than ever: [access to the internet should be a **universal right**](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/04/covid-19-internet-universal-right-lockdown-online){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

But it doesn’t stop there: websites need to be accessible to **everyone**, **regardless of disability**. It seems surreal to have to say this in 2020, but a website designed with accessibility in mind benefits everyone.

Last month, the well-know among knitters and crocheters website Ravelry underwent a **redesign** of the interface. It was a **surprise** for everyone, especially for the ones that started to experience **physical issues** while or after browsing it. At the same time, **screen reader software** stopped working, effectively **blocking** a group of people from accessing the site.

I wrote a blog post about this detailing what happened and explaining what are the **best practices,** from a **UX Design** point of view. You’ll also find some useful articles if you’re interested in knowing more. In the meantime, Ravelry **didn’t fix** the accessibility issues. Moreover, the founders and team closed or made private their social media accounts, and closed the threads about the redesign on the forum: not a good sign of the things to come.

It’s up to us, designers and developers, to build **accessible** websites. It’s up to all of us to call out companies that don’t do it. We are all **responsible** for making the web **accessible**, **usable** and **inclusive**.
